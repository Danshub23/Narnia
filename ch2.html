CHAPTER II
</h3>
<h4>
<i>What Lucy Found There</i>
</h4>
<p>
"Good evening," said Lucy.  But the Faun was so
busy picking up his parcels that at first he did not
reply.  When he had finished he made her a little bow.
</p>
<p>「晚上好，」露西說。但牧神忙著取包裹，起初並沒有回應。取完後，他微微鞠了一躬。</p>
<p>
"Good evening, good evening," said the Faun.  "Excuse
me—I don't want to be inquisitive—but should I be right
in thinking that you are a Daughter of Eve?"
</p>
<p>「晚上好，晚上好，」牧神說。 「請問——我不想多管閒事——但我可以肯定地說，您是夏娃的女兒嗎？”</p>
<p>
"My name's Lucy," said she, not quite understanding him.
</p>
<p>「我叫露西，」她說道，似乎不太明白他的意思。</p> 
<p>
"But you are—forgive me—you are what they call a
girl?" asked the Faun.
</p>
<p>「但是您——請原諒——您是人們所說的女孩？」牧神問。</p>
<p>
"Of course I'm a girl," said Lucy.
</p>
<p>「我當然是女孩，」露西說。</p> 
"You are in fact Human?"
</p>
<p>“您實際上是人類？”</p>
<p>
"Of course I'm human," said Lucy, still a little puzzled.
</p>
<p>「我當然是人類，」露西說道，仍然有些疑惑。</p>
<p>
"To be sure, to be sure," said the Faun.  "How stupid of
me!  But I've never seen a Son of Adam or a Daughter of
Eve before.  I am delighted.  That is to say—" and then he
stopped as if he had been going to say something he had
not intended but had remembered in time.  "Delighted,
delighted," he went on.  "Allow me to introduce myself.
My name is Tumnus."
</p>
<p>「當然，當然，」牧神說。 「我真是太傻了！我以前從未見過亞當之子或夏娃之女。
    我真是太高興了。也就是說——」他突然停了下來，彷彿原本想說些什麼，但又突然想
    起來了。 “高興，高興，”他繼續說道，“請允許我自我介紹一下。我叫圖姆努斯。”
</p>
<p>
"I am very pleased to meet you, Mr. Tumnus," said Lucy.
</p>
<p>「很高興見到您，圖姆努斯先生，」露西說。</p>
<p>
"And may I ask, O Lucy, Daughter of Eve," said
Mr. Tumnus, "how you have come into Narnia?"
</p>
<p>“露西，夏娃之女，”圖姆努斯先生問道，“請問您是如何來到納尼亞的？”</p>  
<p>
"Narnia?  What's that?" said Lucy.
</p>
    <p>「納尼亞？那是什麼地方？」露西問。</p>
<p>
"This is the land of Narnia," said the Faun, "where we
are now; all that lies between the lamp-post and the
great castle of Cair Paravel on the eastern sea.  And
you—you have come from the wild woods of the west?"
</p>
<p>「這就是納尼亞，」牧神說道，“我們現在所在的地方；從路燈到東
    海邊的凱爾帕拉瓦爾城堡之間的所有地方。而你——你是從西方的荒野森林來的嗎？”</p>
<p>
"I—I got in through the wardrobe in the spare room,"
said Lucy.
</p>
<p>「我……我是從客房的衣櫥裡進來的，」露西說。</p>
<p>
"Ah!" said Mr. Tumnus in a rather melancholy voice,
"if only I had worked harder at geography when I was a
little Faun, I should no doubt know all about those strange
countries.  It is too late now."
</p>
    <p>“唉！”圖姆努斯先生略帶憂傷地說，“如果我小時候是個小羊人的時候地理學得好一點，
    我肯定早就知道那些奇特的國度了。現在太晚了。”</p>
<p>
"But they aren't countries at all," said Lucy, almost
laughing.  "It's only just back there—at least—I'm not
sure.  It is summer there."
</p>
<p>“可是它們根本不是國度，”露西幾乎要笑出聲來，“它們只是離我們很遠的地方——至少——我不確定。
    那裡現在是夏天。”</p>
<p>
"Meanwhile," said Mr. Tumnus, "it is winter in Narnia,
and has been for ever so long, and we shall both catch cold
if we stand here talking in the snow.  Daughter of Eve
from the far land of Spare Oom where eternal summer
reigns around the bright city of War Drobe, how would it
be if you came and had tea with me?"
</p>
<p>「與此同時，」圖姆努斯先生說，「納尼亞現在是冬天，而且已經持續了很久很久，
    如果我們站在雪地裡聊天，我們都會著涼的。來自遙遠的斯帕爾·奧姆的夏娃之女，
    那裡永恆的夏天籠罩著明亮的戰爭衣櫥城，你願意來和我一起喝杯茶嗎？”</p> 
<p>
"Thank you very much, Mr. Tumnus," said Lucy.  "But
I was wondering whether I ought to be getting back."
</p>
<p>“非常感謝您，圖姆努斯先生，”露西說，“但我正在想我是不是該回去了。”</p>
"It's only just round the corner," said the Faun, "and
there'll be a roaring fire—and toast—and sardines—and
cake."
</p>
<p>“就在拐角處，”牧神說，“那裡有熊熊燃燒的篝火——還有烤麵包——還有沙丁魚——還有蛋糕。”</p>
<p>
"Well, it's very kind of you," said Lucy.  "But I shan't be
able to stay long."
</p>
<p>“哦，你真是太好了，”露西說，“但我不能久留。”</p>
<p>
"If you will take my arm, Daughter of Eve," said Mr. Tumnus,
"I shall be able to hold the umbrella over both
of us.  That's the way.  Now—off we go."
</p>
<P>“夏娃的女兒，如果你挽著我的胳膊，”圖姆努斯先生說，“我就可以為我們倆撐傘了。就這麼辦吧。好了，我們走吧。”</P>
<p>
And so Lucy found herself walking through the wood
arm in arm with this strange creature as if they had known
one another all their lives.
</p>
<P>“夏娃的女兒，如果你挽著我的胳膊，”圖姆努斯先生說，“我就可以為我們倆撐傘了。就這麼辦吧。好了，我們走吧。”</P>
<p>
They had not gone far before they came to a place
where the ground became rough and there were rocks all
about and little hills up and little hills down.  At the bottom
of one small valley Mr. Tumnus turned suddenly aside as
if he were going to walk straight into an unusually large
rock, but at the last moment Lucy found he was leading
her into the entrance of a cave.  As soon as they were inside
she found herself blinking in the light of a wood fire.  Then
Mr. Tumnus stooped and took a flaming piece of wood
out of the fire with a neat little pair of tongs, and lit a
lamp.  "Now we shan't be long," he said, and immediately
put a kettle on.
</p>
<p>他們沒走多遠，就來到一處地勢崎嶇的地方，四周都是岩石，還有起伏的小山丘。
    走到一個小山谷的底部，圖姆努斯先生突然轉向，好像要一頭撞上一塊異常巨大的
    岩石，但就在最後一刻，露西發現他正領著她走進一個山洞的入口。他們一進去，
    露西就被營火的光芒晃得睜不開眼。這時，圖姆努斯先生彎下腰，用一把精緻的小
    鉗子從火堆裡夾出一塊燃燒的木柴，點燃了一盞燈。 「我們很快就回來了，」他說
    著，立刻燒起了水壺。露西心想，她從未到過這麼好的地方。那是一個乾燥、乾淨的
    小洞穴，用紅褐色的石頭砌成，地上鋪著地毯，擺著兩把小椅子（「一把給我，一把
    給朋友，」圖姆努斯先生說），還有一張桌子、一個梳妝台，壁爐上方有個壁爐架，
    上面掛著一幅老牧神畫像，他長著灰白的鬍子。角落有一扇門，露西覺得那一定是通
    往圖姆努斯先生的臥室。牆上有一排書架，上面擺滿了書。露西看著書架，圖姆努斯
    先生正在擺放茶具。書名諸如《西勒諾斯的生平與書信》、《仙女及其習性》、《男
    人、僧侶與獵場看守：民間傳說研究》或《人是神話嗎？ 》等等。
</p>
<p>
Lucy thought she had never been in a nicer place.  It was
a little, dry, clean cave of reddish stone with a carpet on
the floor and two little chairs ("one for me and one for a
friend," said Mr. Tumnus) and a table and a dresser and
a mantelpiece over the fire and above that a picture of an
old Faun with a grey beard.  In one corner there was a
door which Lucy thought must lead to Mr. Tumnus'
bedroom, and on one wall was a shelf full of books.  Lucy
looked at these while he was setting out the tea things.
They had titles like <i>The Life and Letters of Silenus</i> or
<i>Nymphs and Their Ways</i> or <i>Men, Monks and Gamekeepers;
a Study in Popular Legend</i> or <i>Is Man a Myth</i>?
</p>
<p>露西心想，她從未到過這麼美好的地方。那是一個乾燥、乾淨的小洞穴，用紅褐色的石頭砌成，
    地上鋪著地毯，擺著兩把小椅子（「一把給我自己，一把給朋友，」圖姆努斯先生說），一張
    桌子，一個梳妝台，壁爐上方有個壁爐架，上面掛著一幅老牧神畫像，他長著灰白的鬍鬚。洞穴
    一角有一扇門，露西覺得那一定是通往圖姆努斯先生臥室的。牆上有一排書架，上面擺滿了書。
    露西看著書架上的書，圖姆努斯先生正在擺放茶具。書名諸如《西勒諾斯的生平與書信》、《仙
    女及其習俗》、《男人、僧侶與獵場看守：民間傳說研究》或《人是神話嗎？ 》等等。</p>
<p>
"Now, Daughter of Eve!" said the Faun.
</p>
<p>「好了，夏娃的女兒！」牧神說。</p>

<p>
And really it was a wonderful tea.  There was a nice
brown egg, lightly boiled, for each of them, and then
sardines on toast, and then buttered toast, and then toast
with honey, and then a sugar-topped cake.  And when
Lucy was tired of eating the Faun began to talk.  He had
wonderful tales to tell of life in the forest.  He told about
the midnight dances and how the Nymphs who lived in the
wells and the Dryads who lived in the trees came out to
dance with the Fauns; about long hunting parties after
the milk-white Stag who could give you wishes if you
caught him; about feasting and treasure-seeking with the
wild Red Dwarfs in deep mines and caverns far beneath
the forest floor; and then about summer when the woods
were green and old Silenus on his fat donkey would come
to visit them, and sometimes Bacchus himself, and then
the streams would run with wine instead of water and the
whole forest would give itself up to jollification for weeks
on end.  "Not that it isn't always winter now," he added
gloomily.  Then to cheer himself up he took out from its
case on the dresser a strange little flute that looked as if it
were made of straw and began to play.  And the tune he
played made Lucy want to cry and laugh and dance and
go to sleep all at the same time.  It must have been hours
later when she shook herself and said,
</p>
<p>
這下午茶真是太棒了。每個人都有一顆漂亮的棕色水煮蛋，然後是烤沙丁魚吐司，
接著是塗黃油的吐司，然後是蜂蜜吐司，最後是撒滿糖霜的蛋糕。露西吃膩了，牧
神就開始說話了。他講了很多關於森林生活的精彩故事。他講到午夜的舞會，講到
住在井裡的仙女和住在樹上的樹精如何出來與牧神共舞；講到人們如何進行漫長的狩
獵，追捕那頭乳白色的雄鹿，如果你抓住了它，它就能滿足你的願望；講到在森林深
處的礦井和洞穴裡，與野蠻的紅矮人一起享用盛宴、尋寶；然後講到夏天，森林一片
翠綠，老西勒諾斯騎著他肥驢來拜訪他們，有時酒神巴克斯也會親自前來，那時溪流
裡流淌的不是水，而是葡萄酒，整個森林會連續幾週沉浸在歡樂的氣氛中。 「不過，
現在也總是冬天啊，」他悶悶不樂地補充道。為了讓自己開心起來，他從梳妝台上的
盒子裡拿出一支奇怪的小笛子，看起來像是用稻草做的，然後開始吹奏。他吹的曲子
讓露西又想哭又想笑又想跳舞又想睡覺。大概過了幾個小時，她才搖了搖頭，說：
</p>
<p>
"Oh Mr. Tumnus—I'm so sorry to stop you, and I do
love that tune—but really, I must go home.  I only meant
to stay for a few minutes."
</p>
<p>「哦，圖姆努斯先生——真不好意思打斷您，我真的很喜歡這首曲子——但我真的必須回家了。我本來只想待一會兒。”</p>
<p>
"It's no good <i>now</i>, you know," said the Faun, laying
down his flute and shaking his head at her very sorrowfully.
</p>
<p>「現在不行了，你知道的，」牧神說著，放下笛子，悲傷地搖了搖頭。</p>
<p>
"No good?" said Lucy, jumping up and feeling rather
frightened.  "What do you mean?  I've got to go home at
once.  The others will be wondering what has happened to
me."  But a moment later she asked, "Mr. Tumnus!  Whatever
is the matter?" for the Faun's brown eyes had filled
with tears and then the tears began trickling down his
cheeks, and soon they were running off the end of his nose;
and at last he covered his face with his hands and began to
howl.
</p>
<p>「不行了？」露西嚇得跳了起來。 「什麼意思？我得馬上回家。其他人會擔心我怎麼了。」
    但過了一會兒，她又問：「圖姆努斯先生！怎麼了？」只見牧神棕色的眼睛裡噙滿了淚水，
    淚水順著臉頰流了下來，很快又順著鼻尖流了下來；最後，他用雙手摀住臉，嚎啕大哭起來。
</p>
<p>
"Mr. Tumnus!  Mr. Tumnus!" said Lucy in great distress.
"Don't!  Don't!  What is the matter?  Aren't you
well?  Dear Mr. Tumnus, do tell me what is wrong."  But
the Faun continued sobbing as if his heart would break.
And even when Lucy went over and put her arms round
him and lent him her handkerchief, he did not stop.  He
merely took the handkerchief and kept on using it,
wringing it out with both hands whenever it got too wet to be
any more use, so that presently Lucy was standing in a
damp patch.
</p>
<p>「圖姆努斯先生！圖姆努斯先生！」露西驚恐地喊道。 「別哭
    ！別哭！你怎麼了？你不舒服嗎？親愛的圖姆努斯先生，快告
    訴我到底發生了什麼事。」但這位牧神依然哭個不停，彷彿心
    都要碎了。即使露西走過去抱住他，遞給他自己的手帕，他也
    沒有停下來。他只是接過手帕，不停地用，只要太濕就用雙手
    擰乾，沒多久，露西就站在一塊濕漉漉的地上。</p>

<p>
"Mr. Tumnus!" bawled Lucy in his ear, shaking him.
"Do stop.  Stop it at once!  You ought to be ashamed of
yourself, a great big Faun like you.  What on earth are you
crying about?"
</p>
<p>「圖姆努斯先生！」露西在他耳邊大聲喊道，一邊搖晃著他。 「別哭了！快別哭了！你這麼大的牧神，
    竟然哭成這樣，真是丟人！你到底在哭什麼？」</p>
<p>
"Oh—oh—oh!" sobbed Mr. Tumnus, "I'm crying
because I'm such a bad Faun."
</p>
<p>“哦——哦——哦！”圖姆努斯先生抽泣著說，“我哭是因為我是個壞牧神。”</p>
<p>
"I don't think you're a bad Faun at all," said Lucy.  "I
think you are a very good Faun.  You are the nicest Faun
I've ever met."
</p>
<p>“我一點也不覺得你是個壞羊人，”露西說，“我覺得你是個非常好的羊人。你是我見過的最善良的羊人。”</p>
<p>
"Oh—oh—you wouldn't say that if you knew," replied
Mr. Tumnus between his sobs.  "No, I'm a bad Faun.  I
don't suppose there ever was a worse Faun since the
beginning of the world."
</p>
<p>「哦——哦——你要是知道真相就不會這麼說了，」圖姆努斯先生抽泣著回答，“不，我就是個壞羊人。我想，自從世界誕
    生以來，恐怕再也沒有比我更壞的羊人了。”</p>
<p>
"But what have you done?" asked Lucy.
</p>
<p>「可是你都做了什麼？」露西問。</p>
<p>
"My old father, now," said Mr. Tumnus, "that's his
picture over the mantelpiece.  He would never have done
a thing like this."
</p>
<p>“我老父親，”圖姆努斯先生說，“壁爐架上掛著他的畫像。他絕對不會做這種事。”</p>
<p>
"A thing like what?" said Lucy.
</p>

<p>
"Like what I've done," said the Faun.  "Taken service
under the White Witch.  That's what I am.  I'm in the pay
of the White Witch."
</p>
<p>「什麼事？」露西問。</p>
<p>
"The White Witch?  Who is she?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, it is she that has got all Narnia under her thumb.
It's she that makes it always winter.  Always winter and
never Christmas; think of that!"
</p>
<p>“就像我做的這種事，”羊人說，“我為白女巫效力。我就是。我受僱於白女巫。”</p>
<p>
"How awful!" said Lucy.  "But what does she pay you for?"
</p>
<p>“白女巫？她是誰？”</p>
<p>
"That's the worst of it," said Mr. Tumnus with a deep
groan.  "I'm a kidnapper for her, that's what I am.  Look
at me, Daughter of Eve.  Would you believe that I'm the
sort of Faun to meet a poor innocent child in the wood,
one that had never done me any harm, and pretend to be
friendly with it, and invite it home to my cave, all for the
sake of lulling it asleep and then handing it over to the
White Witch?"
</p>
<p>「這才是最糟糕的，」圖姆努斯先生深深地呻吟道。 「我是她的綁架犯，就是這樣。看看我，
    夏娃的女兒。你相信嗎？我這種人會在森林裡遇到一個可憐無辜的孩子，一個從未傷害過我
    的孩子，然後假裝友好地和他相處，邀請他到我的山洞裡，這一切都是為了哄他入睡，然後把他交給白女巫？”</p>
<p>
"No," said Lucy.  "I'm sure you wouldn't do anything of
the sort."
</p>
<p>「不會，」露西說。 “我相信你不會做這種事。”</p>
<p>
"But I have," said the Faun.
</p>
<p>「但我做過，」牧神說。</p>
<p>
"Well," said Lucy rather slowly (for she wanted to be
truthful and yet not to be too hard on him), "well, that
was pretty bad.  But you're so sorry for it that I'm sure you
will never do it again."
</p>
<p>“嗯，”露西緩緩說道（她想實話實說，但又不想對他太苛刻），“嗯，這確實很糟糕。不過你這麼後悔，我相信你以後再也不會這樣了。”</p>
<p>
"Daughter of Eve, don't you understand?" said the
Faun.  "It isn't something I <i>have</i> done.  I'm doing it now,
this very moment."
</p>
<p>“夏娃的女兒，你還不明白嗎？”牧神說道，“這不是我以前做過的事。我現在正在做，就在此刻。”</p>
<p>
"What do you mean?" cried Lucy, turning very white.
</p>
<p>「你什麼意思？」露西驚叫道，臉色瞬間變得慘白。</p>
<p>
"You are the child," said Mr. Tumnus.  "I had orders
from the White Witch that if ever I saw a Son of Adam or
a Daughter of Eve in the wood, I was to catch them and
hand them over to her.  And you are the first I ever met.
And I've pretended to be your friend and asked you to
tea, and all the time I've been meaning to wait till you
were asleep and then go and tell <i>her</i>."
</p>
<p>「你就是那個孩子，」圖姆努斯先生說道，「白女巫命令我，如果我在森林裡看到亞當之子或夏娃之女，
    就一定要抓住他們，交給她。而你是第一個我遇到的。我假裝是你的朋友，邀請你喝茶，其實我一直想著等你睡著了再去告訴她。」</p>
<p>
"Oh but you won't, Mr. Tumnus," said Lucy.  "You
won't, will you?  Indeed, indeed you really mustn't."
</p>
<p>「哦，你不會的，圖姆努斯先生，」露西說。 “你不會的，對吧？真的，真的不能。”</p>
<p>
"And if I don't," said he, beginning to cry again, "she's
sure to find out.  And she'll have my tail cut off, and my
horns sawn off, and my beard plucked out, and she'll wave
her wand over my beautiful cloven hoofs and turn them
into horrid solid hoofs like a wretched horse's.  And if she
is extra and specially angry she'll turn me into stone and I
shall be only a statue of a Faun in her horrible house until
the four thrones at Cair Paravel are filled—and goodness
knows when that will happen, or whether it will ever
happen at all."
</p>
<p>「如果我不去，」他又開始哭了起來，「她肯定會發現的。她會砍掉我的尾巴，鋸掉我的角，拔掉我的鬍子，還會揮動魔杖，
    把我的漂亮蹄子變成像可憐的馬一樣醜陋的實心蹄子。如果她特別生氣，她還會把我變成石頭，
    讓我永遠做她那可怕房子裡的一尊半人半羊的雕像，直到凱爾帕拉瓦爾的四個王座都被填滿——天
    知道那一天什麼時候到來，或者它是否真的會到來。</p>
<p>
"I'm very sorry, Mr. Tumnus," said Lucy.  "But please
let me go home."
</p>
<p>“我很抱歉，圖姆努斯先生，”露西說，“但請讓我回家。”</p>
<p>
"Of course I will," said the Faun.  "Of course I've got to.
I see that now.  I hadn't known what Humans were like
before I met you.  Of course I can't give you up to the
Witch; not now that I know you.  But we must be off at
once.  I'll see you back to the lamp-post.  I suppose you can
find your own way from there back to Spare Oom and
War Drobe?"
</p>
<p>「當然可以，」半人半羊的人說。 「當然，我必須這麼做。我現在明白了。在遇見你之前，我根本不知道人類是什麼樣的人。
我當然不能把你交給女巫；現在我認識你了，就更不能這麼做了。但我們必須馬上出發。我會送你回到路燈那裡。我想你應該能找到
備用屋的備用路吧？」</p>
<p>
"I'm sure I can," said Lucy.
</p>
<p>「我肯定可以，」露西說。</p>
<p>
"We must go as quietly as we can," said Mr. Tumnus.
"The whole wood is full of <i>her</i> spies.  Even some of the
trees are on her side."
</p>
<p>「我們必須盡可能悄悄地走，」圖姆努斯先生說。 “整片森林裡到處都是她的眼線。甚至有些樹都站在她那邊。”</p>
<p>
They both got up and left the tea things on the table,
and Mr. Tumnus once more put up his umbrella and gave
Lucy his arm, and they went out into the snow.  The
journey back was not at all like the journey to the Faun's
cave; they stole along as quickly as they could, without
speaking a word, and Mr. Tumnus kept to the darkest
places.  Lucy was relieved when they reached the
lamp-post again.
</p>
<p>他們倆起身，把茶具留在桌上，圖姆努斯先生再次撐起傘，挽著露西的胳膊，他們走進了雪地裡。
    回去的路和去牧神洞穴的路完全不同；他們盡可能快地躡手躡腳地走著，一句話也沒說，圖姆努斯
    先生則盡量走在最黑暗的地方。當他們再次走到路燈柱旁時，露西鬆了一口氣。</p>
<p>
"Do you know your way from here, Daughter of Eve?"
said Tumnus.
</p>
<p>「夏娃的女兒，你知道從這裡怎麼走嗎？」圖姆努斯問。</p>
<p>
Lucy looked very hard between the trees and could just
see in the distance a patch of light that looked like
daylight.  "Yes," she said, "I can see the wardrobe door."
</p>
<p>露西仔細地透過樹叢望去，隱約看到遠處有一小片光亮，像是日光。 “是的，”她說，“我能看到衣櫃門。”</p>
<p>
"Then be off home as quick as you can," said the Faun,
"and—c-can you ever forgive me for what I meant to do?"
</p>
<p>“那就趕緊回家吧，”牧神說道，“還有——你還能原諒我剛才想做的事嗎？”</p>
<p>
"Why, of course I can," said Lucy, shaking him heartily
by the hand.  "And I do hope you won't get into dreadful
trouble on my account."
</p>
<p>「當然可以，」露西說著，用力地握了握他的手。 “我希望你不會因為我而惹上大麻煩。”</p>
<p>
"Farewell, Daughter of Eve," said he.  "Perhaps I may
keep the handkerchief?"
</p>
<p>「再見了，夏娃的女兒，」他說。 “也許我可以留下這條手帕？”</p>
<p>
"Rather!" said Lucy, and then ran towards the far-off
patch of daylight as quickly as her legs would carry her.
And presently instead of rough branches brushing past her
she felt coats, and instead of crunching snow under her
feet she felt wooden boards, and all at once she found
herself jumping out of the wardrobe into the same empty room
from which the whole adventure had started.  She shut the
wardrobe door tightly behind her and looked around,
panting for breath.  It was still raining and she could hear
the voices of the others in the passage.
