<i>Turkish Delight</i>
</h4>
<p>"But what are you?" said the Queen again.  "Are youa great overgrown dwarf that has cut off its beard."</p>
<p>「可是你是什麼人？」女王又問。 “你是個剃了鬍子的矮大個子嗎？”</p>
<p>"No, your Majesty," said Edmund, "I never had abeard, I'm a boy."</p>
<p>“不，陛下，”埃德蒙說，“我從來沒有鬍子，我是個男孩。”</p>
<p>"A boy!" said she.  "Do you mean you are a Son of Adam?"</p>
<p>「男孩！」她驚呼。 “你是說你是亞當的後裔嗎？”</p>
<p>Edmund stood still, saying nothing.  He was too confusedby this time to understand what the question meant.</p>
<p>埃德蒙呆立不動，一言不發。此時他已經完全糊塗了，根本無法理解女王的問題。</p>
<p>"I see you are an idiot, whatever else you may be," saidthe Queen.  "Answer me, once and for all, or I shall losemy patience.  Are you human?"</p>
<p>「看來你是個白痴，不管你是什麼，」女王說。 「回答我，一勞永逸，否則我就要失去耐心了。你是人嗎？”</p>
<p>"Yes, your Majesty," said Edmund.</p>
<p>「是的，陛下，」艾德蒙答道。</p>
<p>"And how, pray, did you come to enter my dominions?"</p>
<p>“那麼，請問，你是如何來到我的領地的？”</p>
<p>"Please, your Majesty, I came in through a wardrobe."</p>
<p>“陛下，我是從衣櫥進來的。”</p>
<p>"A wardrobe?  What do you mean?"</p>
<p>“衣櫥？你是什麼意思？”</p>
<p>"I—I opened a door and just found myself here, yourMajesty," said Edmund.</p>
<p>「我……我打開了一扇門，然後就發現自己身處此地，陛下，」艾德蒙說。</p>
<p>"Ha!" said the Queen, speaking more to herself than tohim.  "A door.  A door from the world of men!  I have heardof such things.  This may wreck all.  But he is only one, andhe is easily dealt with."  As she spoke these words she rosefrom her seat and looked Edmund full in the face, her eyesflaming; at the same moment she raised her wand.  Edmundfelt sure that she was going to do something dreadfulbut he seemed unable to move.  Then, just as he gavehimself up for lost, she appeared to change her mind.</p>
<p>「哈！」王后喃喃自語，與其說是對他說，不如說是自言自語。 「一扇門。一扇通往人間的門！我聽說過這種東西。這可能會毀了一切。但他只是一個人，很容易對付。」說著，她起身直視埃德蒙的臉，雙眼怒火中燒；同時，她舉起了魔杖。艾德蒙確信她要做什麼可怕的事情，但他卻動彈不得。就在他徹底絕望的時候，王后似乎改變了主意。</p>
<p>"My poor child," she said in quite a different voice,"how cold you look!  Come and sit with me here on thesledge and I will put my mantle around you and we willtalk."</p>
<p>「我可憐的孩子，」她換了一種語氣說道，“你看上去很冷！過來，和我一起坐在雪橇上，我把我的斗篷披在你身上，我們好好談談。”</p>
<p>Edmund did not like this arrangement at all but hedared not disobey; he stepped on to the sledge and sat ather feet, and she put a fold of her fur mantle around himand tucked it well in.</p>
<p>艾德蒙一點也不喜歡這樣的安排，但他不敢違抗。他踏上雪橇，坐在女王腳邊。女王用皮毛披風的一塊布料裹住他，掖好。</p>
<p>"Perhaps something hot to drink?" said the Queen."Should you like that?"</p>
<p>“想喝點熱飲嗎？”女王問道，“您想喝嗎？”</p>
<p>"Yes please, your Majesty," said Edmund, whose teethwere chattering.</p>
<p>「是的，陛下。」艾德蒙牙齒打顫地說。</p>
<p>The Queen took from somewhere among her wrappingsa very small bottle which looked as if it were made ofcopper.  Then, holding out her arm, she let one drop fallfrom it on to the snow beside the sledge.  Edmund saw thedrop for a second in mid-air, shining like a diamond.  Butthe moment it touched the snow there was a hissing soundand there stood a jewelled cup full of something thatsteamed.  The Dwarf immediately took this and handed itto Edmund with a bow and a smile; not a very nice smile.Edmund felt much better as he began to sip the hot drink.It was something he had never tasted before, very sweetand foamy and creamy, and it warmed him right down tohis toes.</p>
<p>女王從裹布中取出一個小瓶子，看起來像是銅製的。然後，她伸出手臂，讓瓶子裡的一滴水滴落在雪橇旁的雪地上。艾德蒙看到那滴水在半空中停留了一瞬，閃閃發光，如同鑽石。但水滴落地的瞬間，傳來嘶嘶聲，一隻鑲滿寶石的杯子映入眼簾，裡面盛滿了冒著熱氣的液體。矮人立刻接過杯子，鞠躬微笑著遞給艾德蒙──那笑容並不友善。艾德蒙啜飲著熱飲，感覺好多了。這是他從未嚐過的味道，香甜綿密，奶香濃鬱，一口下去，暖洋洋的，從腳趾頭一直暖到腳趾頭。</p>
<p>"It is dull, Son of Adam, to drink without eating," saidthe Queen presently.  "What would you like best to eat?"</p>
<p>“光喝不吃東西，亞當之子，實在乏味。”王后過了一會兒說道，“您想吃什麼呢？”</p>
<p>"Turkish Delight, please, your Majesty," said Edmund.</p>
<p>「陛下，請給我土耳其軟糖。」艾德蒙答道。</p>
<p>The Queen let another drop fall from her bottle on tothe snow, and instantly there appeared a round box, tiedwith green silk ribbon, which, when opened, turned out tocontain several pounds of the best Turkish Delight.  Eachpiece was sweet and light to the very centre and Edmundhad never tasted anything more delicious.  He was quitewarm now, and very comfortable.</p>
<p>王后又從瓶子裡滴了一滴在雪地上，雪地上立刻出現了一個用綠色絲帶繫著的圓形盒子。打開盒子，裡面裝著好幾磅上等的土耳其軟糖。每一塊都香甜鬆軟，從裡到外都散發著誘人的香氣，埃德蒙從未嚐過如此美味的東西。他現在感覺暖洋洋的，非常舒服。</p>
<p>While he was eating the Queen kept asking him questions.At first Edmund tried to remember that it is rudeto speak with one's mouth full, but soon he forgot aboutthis and thought only of trying to shovel down as muchTurkish Delight as he could, and the more he ate the morehe wanted to eat, and he never asked himself why theQueen should be so inquisitive.  She got him to tell her thathe had one brother and two sisters, and that one of hissisters had already been in Narnia and had met a Faunthere, and that no one except himself and his brother andhis sisters knew anything about Narnia.  She seemedespecially interested in the fact that there were four of them,and kept on coming back to it.  "You are sure there arejust four of you?" she asked.  "Two Sons of Adam and twoDaughters of Eve, neither more nor less?" and Edmund,with his mouth full of Turkish Delight, kept on saying,"Yes, I told you that before," and forgetting to call her"Your Majesty" but she didn't seem to mind now.</p>
<p>他吃軟糖的時候，王后不停地問他問題。起初，艾德蒙努力回想嘴裡塞滿東西說話是不禮貌的，但很快他就忘了這茬，滿腦子想的都是盡可能多地往嘴裡塞土耳其軟糖。他越吃越想吃，完全沒想過女王為什麼這麼愛打聽。女王要他告訴她，他有一個哥哥和兩個姐姐，其中一個姐姐去過納尼亞，在那裡見過一個半人半羊的牧神，除了他和他哥哥姐姐，沒人知道納尼亞的事。女王似乎對他們一家四口特別感興趣，反覆追問。 「你確定只有四個人嗎？」她問，「亞當的兩個兒子，夏娃的兩個女兒，不多也不少？」埃德蒙嘴裡塞滿了土耳其軟糖，不停地說：“是的，我之前告訴過你。”他忘了稱呼女王“陛下”，但她現在似乎並不在意。</p>
<p>At last the Turkish Delight was all finished and Edmundwas looking very hard at the empty box and wishing thatshe would ask him whether he would like some more.Probably the Queen knew quite well what he was thinking;for she knew, though Edmund did not, that this wasenchanted Turkish Delight and that anyone who had oncetasted it would want more and more of it, and would even,if they were allowed, go on eating it till they killedthemselves.  But she did not offer him any more.  Instead, shesaid to him,</p>
<p>土耳其軟糖終於吃完了，艾德蒙盯著空盒子發呆，心裡盼她能問他是否還想再吃一些。或許王后很清楚他在想什麼；因為她知道，儘管埃德蒙並不知道，這是有魔力的土耳其軟糖，任何嚐過的人都會欲罷不能，甚至如果可以的話，會一直吃到自殺。但她沒有再給他。相反，她對他說：</p>
<p>"Son of Adam, I should so much like to see your brotherand your two sisters.  Will you bring them to see me?"</p>
<p>“亞當之子，我真想見見你的弟弟和兩個妹妹。你能帶他們來見我嗎？”</p>
<p>"I'll try," said Edmund, still looking at the empty box.</p>
<p>「我試試，」艾德蒙說著，眼睛仍然盯著那個空盒子。</p>
<p>"Because, if you did come again—bringing them withyou of course—I'd be able to give you some more TurkishDelight.  I can't do it now, the magic will only work once.In my own house it would be another matter."</p>
<p>「因為，如果你能再來——當然要帶上他們——我就能再給你一些土耳其軟糖了。我現在不行，魔法只能用一次。在我自己家裡就另當別論了。”</p>
<p>"Why can't we go to your house now?" said Edmund.When he had first got on to the sledge he had been afraidthat she might drive away with him to some unknownplace from which he would not be able to get back, buthe had forgotten about that fear now.</p>
<p>「為什麼我們現在不能去你家呢？」艾德蒙問。他剛坐上雪橇的時候，還擔心她會帶他去某個不知名的地方，讓他再也回不來，但現在他已經忘了這種擔憂。</p>
<p>"It is a lovely place, my house," said the Queen.  "I amsure you would like it.  There are whole rooms full ofTurkish Delight, and what's more, I have no children ofmy own.  I want a nice boy whom I could bring up as aPrince and who would be King of Narnia when I am gone.While he was Prince he would wear a gold crown and eatTurkish Delight all day long; and you are much thecleverest and handsomest young man I've ever met.  I think Iwould like to make you the Prince—some day, when youbring the others to visit me."</p>
<p>「我家是個很美的地方，」王后說。 「我相信你會喜歡的。這裡有滿滿幾屋子的土耳其軟糖，而且，我沒有自己的孩子。我想要一個好男孩，我可以把他培養成王子，等我走了以後，他就能成為納尼亞的國王。當他是王子的時候，他會戴著金冠，整天吃土耳其軟糖；而你是我見過的最聰明、最英俊的年輕人。</p>
<p>"Why not now?" said Edmund.  His face had becomevery red and his mouth and fingers were sticky.  He did notlook either clever or handsome whatever the Queen mightsay.</p>
<p>「為什麼不現在呢？」艾德蒙說。他的臉漲得通紅，嘴巴和手指都黏黏的。不管王后怎麼說，他看起來既不聰明也不英俊。</p>
<p>"Oh, but if I took you there now," said she, "I shouldn'tsee your brother and your sisters.  I very much want toknow your charming relations.  You are to be the Princeand—later on—the King; that is understood.  But youmust have courtiers and nobles.  I will make your brothera Duke and your sisters Duchesses."</p>
<p>「哦，可是如果我現在帶你去那裡，」她說，「我就見不到你的兄弟姐妹了。我很想認識你那些迷人的親戚。你將成為王子，以後——成為國王；這沒問題。但你必須有廷臣和貴族。我會封你的哥哥為公爵，封你的姐姐為公爵夫人。”</p>
<p>"There's nothing special about <i>them</i>," said Edmund,"and, anyway, I could always bring them some other time."</p>
<p>“它們沒什麼特別的，”埃德蒙說，“而且，反正我以後隨時都可以帶它們來。”</p>
<p>"Ah, but once you were in my house," said the Queen,"you might forget all about them.  You would be enjoyingyourself so much that you wouldn't want the bother ofgoing to fetch them.  No.  You must go back to your owncountry now and come to me another day, <i>with them</i>, youunderstand.  It is no good coming without them."</p>
<p>「啊，可是一旦你進了我的房子，」王后說，「你可能會把它們忘得一干二淨。你會玩得那麼開心，根本不想費勁去把它們帶回來。不行。你現在必須回你的國家，改天帶著它們來見我，明白嗎？不帶它們來是沒用的。」</p>
<p>"But I don't even know the way back to my owncountry," pleaded Edmund.</p>
<p>「可是我連回自己國家的路都不知道，」艾德蒙懇求道。</p>
<p>"That's easy," answered the Queen.  "Do you see thatlamp?"  She pointed with her wand and Edmund turnedand saw the same lamp-post under which Lucy had met theFaun.  "Straight on, beyond that, is the way to the Worldof Men.  And now look the other way"—here she pointedin the opposite direction—"and tell me if you can see twolittle hills rising above the trees."</p>
<p>「這很簡單，」王后回答。 「你看到那盞燈了嗎？」她用魔杖指了指，艾德蒙轉過身，看到了露西遇見半人羊的那盞燈。 「再往前走，過了那盞燈，就是通往人類世界的路。現在往另一邊看」——她指了指相反的方向——“告訴我，你能看到樹叢上方的兩座小山嗎？”</p>
<p>"I think I can," said Edmund.</p>
<p>「我想我可以，」艾德蒙說。</p>
<p>"Well my house is between those two hills.  So next timeyou come you have only to find the lamp-post and lookfor those two hills and walk through the wood till you reachmy house.  You had better keep the river on your rightwhen you get to it.  But remember—you must bring theothers with you.  I might have to be very angry with youif you came alone."</p>
<p>「嗯，我的房子就在這兩座小山中間。所以下次你來的時候，只要找到路燈，再找到那兩座小山，穿過樹林就能到我家了。到了之後，最好讓河在你的右邊。不過記住——你必須帶上其他人。如果你一個人來，我可能會很生氣。」</p>
<p>"I'll do my best," said Edmund.</p>
<p>「我會盡力的，」艾德蒙說。</p>
<p>"And, by the way," said the Queen, "you needn't tellthem about me.  It would be fun to keep it a secret betweenus two, wouldn't it?  Make it a surprise for them.  Justbring them along to the two hills—a clever boy like youwill easily think of some excuse for doing that—and whenyou come to my house you could just say 'Let's see wholives here' or something like that.  I am sure that would bebest.  If your sister has met one of the Fauns, she may haveheard strange stories about me—nasty stories that mightmake her afraid to come to me.  Fauns will say anything,you know, and now—"</p>
<p>「對了，」王后說，「你不用告訴他們我的事。我們倆保守這個秘密豈不是很有趣？給他們一個驚喜。帶他們去那兩座小山上——像你這麼聰明的孩子，肯定能想出個藉口——等你們到了我家，就說『咱們去看看誰住這兒’之類的。</p>
<p>"Please, please," said Edmund suddenly, "pleasecouldn't I have just one piece of Turkish Delight to eat onthe way home?"</p>
<p>“求求你，”埃德蒙突然說道，“求求你，我能不能在回家的路上吃一塊土耳其軟糖？”</p>
<p>"No, no," said the Queen with a laugh, "you must waittill next time."  While she spoke, she signalled to the Dwarfto drive on, but as the sledge swept away out of sight, theQueen waved to Edmund calling out, "Next time!  Nexttime!  Don't forget.  Come soon."</p>
<p>“不行，不行，”王后笑著說，“你得等到下次。”說著，她示意矮人繼續趕雪橇，但當雪橇飛馳而去，消失在視線中時，王后向埃德蒙揮手，喊道：“下次！下次！別忘了。快點來。”</p>
<p>Edmund was still staring after the sledge when heheard someone calling his own name, and looking roundhe saw Lucy coming towards him from another part of thewood.</p>
<p>艾德蒙還在望著雪橇遠去的背影，這時他聽到有人在叫他的名字，回頭一看，只見露西正從樹林的另一邊朝他走來。</p>
<p>"Oh, Edmund!" she cried.  "So you've got in too!  Isn'tit wonderful, and now—"</p>
<p>“哦，埃德蒙！”她喊道，“你也進來了！真是太棒了，現在——”</p>
<p>"All right," said Edmund, "I see you were right and itis a magic wardrobe after all.  I'll say I'm sorry if youlike.  But where on earth have you been all this time?  I'vebeen looking for you everywhere."</p>
<p>“好吧，”埃德蒙說，“看來你是對的，這果然是個魔法衣櫥。如果你願意，我可以向你道歉。可是你這些日子都去哪兒了？我到處找你呢。”</p>
<p>"If I'd known you had got in I'd have waited for you,"said Lucy who was too happy and excited to notice howsnappishly Edmund spoke or how flushed and strange hisface was.  "I've been having lunch with dear Mr. Tumnus,the Faun, and he's very well and the White Witch has donenothing to him for letting me go, so he thinks she can'thave found out and perhaps everything is going to be allright after all."</p>
<p>「如果我知道你進去了，我一定會等你的。」露西興奮地說，她高興得根本沒注意到埃德蒙說話的語氣有多生硬，也沒注意到他漲得通紅，臉色怪異。 「我和親愛的圖姆努斯先生，那位半羊人，一起吃了午飯，他很好。白女巫也沒因為我放我走而責怪他，所以他覺得她不可能知道，也許一切都會好起來的。”</p>
<p>"The White Witch?" said Edmund, "who's she?"</p>
<p>“白女巫？”埃德蒙問，“她是誰？”</p>
<p>"She is a perfectly terrible person," said Lucy.  "Shecalls herself the Queen of Narnia though she has no rightto be queen at all, and all the Fauns and Dryads andNaiads and dwarfs and animals—at least all the goodones—simply hate her.  And she can turn people into stoneand do all kinds of horrible things.  And she has made amagic so that it is always winter in Narnia—always winter,but it never gets to Christmas.  And she drives about on asledge, drawn by a reindeer, with her wand in her handand a crown on her head."</p>
<p>「她是個十足的壞人。」露西說。 「她自稱是納尼亞女王，但她根本沒有資格當女王。所有的半人半羊的牧神、樹精、水仙女、矮人和動物——至少所有善良的——都恨她入骨。她能把人變成石頭，還能做各種可怕的事情。她施了魔法，讓納尼亞永遠都是王冠——永遠是冬天，冬天卻能做過各種可怕的事情。她施了魔法，讓納尼亞帶著雪橇處，永遠是冬天，冬天卻做不著聖誕節。</p>
<p>Edmund was already feeling uncomfortable from havingeaten too many sweets, and when he heard that theLady he had made friends with was a dangerous witch hefelt even more uncomfortable.  But he still wanted to tastethat Turkish Delight again more than he wanted anythingelse.</p>
<p>艾德蒙已經因為吃了太多甜食而感到不舒服，當他聽說自己認識的那位女士是個危險的女巫時，他更難受了。但他還是比什麼都更想再嚐嚐那塊土耳其軟糖。</p>
<p>"Who told you all that stuff about the White Witch?"he asked.</p>
<p>「誰跟你說的白女巫的事？」他問。</p>
<p>"Mr. Tumnus, the Faun," said Lucy.</p>
<p>「是牧神圖姆努斯先生，」露西說。</p>
<p>"You can't always believe what Fauns say," saidEdmund, trying to sound as if he knew far more about themthan Lucy.</p>
<p>「你不能總是相信半人半羊人說的話，」艾德蒙說道，努力讓自己聽起來比露西更了解他們。</p>
<p>"Who said so?" asked Lucy.</p>
<p>「誰說的？」露西問。</p>
<p>"Everyone knows it," said Edmund, "ask anybody youlike.  But it's pretty poor sport standing here in the snow.Let's go home."</p>
<p>“人人都知道，”埃德蒙說，“你想問誰就問誰。不過站在雪地裡實在太沒意思了。我們回家吧。”</p>
<p>"Yes, let's," said Lucy.  "Oh Edmund, I <i>am</i> glad you'vegot in too.  The others will have to believe in Narnia nowthat both of us have been there.  What fun it will be."</p>
<p>「好啊，我們回家吧，」露西說。 「哦，埃德蒙，我很高興你也來了。既然我們倆都去過納尼亞，其他人肯定也得相信那裡的存在了。那該多有趣啊！”</p>
<p>But Edmund secretly thought that it would not be asgood fun for him as for her.  He would have to admit thatLucy had been right, before all the others, and he felt surethe others would all be on the side of the Fauns and theanimals; but he was already more than half on the side ofthe Witch.  He did not know what he would say, or howhe would keep his secret once they were all talking aboutNarnia.</p>
<p>但埃德蒙心裡卻暗自覺得，對他來說，這樂趣恐怕不如對她那麼大。他不得不承認露西是對的，而且是在其他人之前就承認了。他確信其他人都會站在半人半羊人和動物們這邊；但他自己卻已經半信半疑地站在女巫那邊了。他不知道自己該怎麼說，也不知道一旦大家開始談論納尼亞，他該如何保守自己的秘密。</p>
<p>By this time they had walked a good way.  Then suddenlythey felt coats around them instead of branches and nextmoment they were both standing outside the wardrobe inthe empty room.</p>
<p>這時他們已經走了很遠的路。突然，他們感覺周圍不再是樹枝，而是外套，下一刻，他們就站在空蕩蕩的房間裡，衣櫃門外。</p>
<p>"I say," said Lucy, "you do look awful, Edmund.  Don'tyou feel well?"</p>
<p>“我說，”露西說，“埃德蒙，你看起來很糟糕。你不舒服嗎？”</p>
<p>"I'm all right," said Edmund, but this was not true.  Hewas feeling very sick.</p>
<p>「我沒事，」艾德蒙說，但這並非事實。他感覺非常難受。</p>
<p>"Come on then," said Lucy, "let's find the others.  Whata lot we shall have to tell them!  And what wonderfuladventures we shall have now that we're all in it together."</p>
<p>“走吧，”露西說，“我們去找其他人。我們有很多事要告訴他們！現在我們在一起，將會經歷多麼精彩的冒險啊！”</p>
