<p>Lucy ran out of the empty room into the passage andfound the other three.</p>
<p>露西跑出空蕩蕩的房間，來到走廊，找到了其他三個人。</p>
<p>"It's all right," she repeated, "I've come back."</p>
<p>“沒事了，”她重複道，“我回來了。”</p>
<p>"What on earth are you talking about, Lucy?" askedSusan.</p>
<p>「露西，你到底在說什麼？」蘇珊問。</p>
<p>"Why?" said Lucy in amazement, "haven't you all beenwondering where I was?"</p>
<p>“怎麼了？”露西驚訝地說，“你們不想知道我去了哪裡嗎？”</p>
<p>"So you've been hiding, have you?" said Peter.  "Poorold Lu, hiding and nobody noticed!  You'll have to hidelonger than that if you want people to start looking foryou."</p>
<p>「所以你一直在躲著？」彼得說。 「可憐的露西，躲了這麼久居然沒人發現！你要是想讓別人找你，就得躲得更久才行。”</p>
<p>"But I've been away for hours and hours," said Lucy.</p>
<p>「可是我已經離開好幾個小時了，」露西說。</p>
<p>The others all stared at one another.</p>
<p>其他人面面相覷。</p>
<p>"Batty!" said Edmund tapping his head.  "Quite batty."</p>
<p>「瘋子！」艾德蒙拍了拍自己的腦袋說。 “真是瘋了。”</p>
<p>"What do you mean, Lu?" asked Peter.</p>
<p>「露西，你什麼意思？」彼得問。</p>
<p>"What I said," answered Lucy.  "It was just afterbreakfast when I went into the wardrobe, and I've been awayfor hours and hours, and had tea, and all sorts of thingshave happened."</p>
<p>「我剛才說的，」露西回答。 “我剛吃完早餐就進了衣櫥，一進去就待了好幾個小時，喝了茶，還發生了很多很多事。”</p>
<p>"Don't be silly, Lucy," said Susan.  "We've only justcome out of that room a moment ago, and you were there then."</p>
<p>“別傻了，露西，”蘇珊說，“我們剛才才從那個房間出來，你當時也在裡面。”</p>
<p>"She's not being silly at all," said Peter, "she's justmaking up a story for fun, aren't you, Lu?  And why shouldn'tshe?"</p>
<p>“她一點也不傻，”彼得說，“她只是在編故事玩，對吧，露西？她為什麼不應該呢？”</p>
<p>"No, Peter, I'm not," she said.  "It's—it's a magic wardrobe.There's a wood inside it, and it's snowing, and there'sa Faun and a witch and it's called Narnia; come and see."</p>
<p>“不，彼得，我沒有，”她說，“那——那是一個魔法衣櫥。裡面有一片樹林，正在下雪，還有一個半人半羊的牧神和一個女巫，那裡叫納尼亞；快來看看吧。”</p>
<p>The others did not know what to think, but Lucy wasso excited that they all went back with her into the room.She rushed ahead of them, flung open the door of thewardrobe and cried, "Now! go in and see for yourselves."</p>
<p>其他人不知道該怎麼想，但露西興奮極了，他們都跟著她回房間了。她衝到他們前面，猛地打開衣櫥的門，喊道：“快！進去看看吧！”</p>
<p>"Why, you goose," said Susan, putting her head insideand pulling the fur coats apart, "it's just an ordinarywardrobe, look! there's the back of it."</p>
<p>“你這傻瓜，”蘇珊說著，把頭伸進衣櫃，把皮草大衣拉開，“這只是個普通的衣櫃，你看！這是它的背面。”</p>
<p>Then everyone looked in and pulled the coats apart; andthey all saw—Lucy herself saw—a perfectly ordinarywardrobe.  There was no wood and no snow, only the backof the wardrobe, with hooks on it.  Peter went in andrapped his knuckles on it to make sure that it wassolid.</p>
<p>然後大家都往裡面看了看，也把大衣拉開；他們都看到了──露西自己也看到了──一個非常普通的衣櫃。沒有木頭，也沒有雪，只有衣櫃的背面，上面有幾個掛鉤。彼得走了進去，用指關節敲了敲，確保它很結實。</p>
<p>"A jolly good hoax, Lu," he said as he came out again,"you have really taken us in, I must admit.  We halfbelieved you."</p>
<p>“真是個高明的騙局，露西，”他走出來時說道，“我得承認，你真的把我們都騙到了。我們差點就信了。”</p>
<p>"But it wasn't a hoax at all," said Lucy, "really andtruly.  It was all different a moment ago.  Honestly it was.I promise."</p>
<p>“但這根本不是騙局，”露西說，“真的，一點也不假。剛才還不是這樣。真的，我發誓。”</p>
<p>"Come, Lu," said Peter, "that's going a bit far.  You'vehad your joke.  Hadn't you better drop it now?"</p>
<p>“好了，露西，”彼得說，“你有點過分了。你的玩笑開夠了。你最好就此打住吧？”</p>
<p>Lucy grew very red in the face and tried to say something,though she hardly knew what she was trying to say,and burst into tears.</p>
<p>露西的臉漲得通紅，她想說些什麼，卻又不知自己究竟想說什麼，最後竟嚎啕大哭起來。</p>
<p>For the next few days she was very miserable.  She couldhave made it up with the others quite easily at any momentif she could have brought herself to say that the wholething was only a story made up for fun.  But Lucy was avery truthful girl and she knew that she was really in theright; and she could not bring herself to say this.  Theothers who thought she was telling a lie, and a silly lie too,made her very unhappy.  The two elder ones did thiswithout meaning to do it, but Edmund could be spiteful, and onthis occasion he was spiteful.  He sneered and jeered atLucy and kept on asking her if she'd found any other newcountries in other cupboards all over the house.  Whatmade it worse was that these days ought to have beendelightful.  The weather was fine and they were out of doorsfrom morning to night, bathing, fishing, climbing trees,birds' nesting, and lying in the heather.  But Lucy couldnot properly enjoy any of it.  And so things went on untilthe next wet day.</p>
<p>接下來的幾天，她都非常難過。如果她能開口說這一切都只是她為了好玩而編的故事，她隨時都可以和大家和好。但露西是個非常誠實的女孩，她知道自己是對的；她實在說不出口。其他人認為她在撒謊，而且還是個很愚蠢的謊言，這讓她非常難過。兩個大孩子並非有意如此，但艾德蒙卻心懷惡意，這次他尤其如此。他嘲笑露西，不停地問她是否在屋子其他地方的櫥櫃裡發現了其他新的國家。更糟的是，這幾天本該是快樂的。天氣晴朗，她們從早到晚都在戶外玩耍：洗澡、釣魚、爬樹、看鳥兒築巢、躺在石楠叢中。但露西一點兒也享受不到。就這樣，直到下一個雨天到來。</p>
<p>That day, when it came to the afternoon and there wasstill no sign of a break in the weather, they decided to playhide-and-seek.  Susan was "It" and as soon as the othersscattered to hide, Lucy went to the room where thewardrobe was.  She did not mean to hide in the wardrobe,because she knew that would only set the others talking againabout the whole wretched business.  But she did want tohave one more look inside it; for by this time she wasbeginning to wonder herself whether Narnia and the Faunhad not been a dream.  The house was so large andcomplicated and full of hiding places that she thought shewould have time to have one look into the wardrobe andthen hide somewhere else.  But as soon as she reached it sheheard steps in the passage outside, and then there wasnothing for it but to jump into the wardrobe and hold thedoor closed behind her.  She did not shut it properlybecause she knew that it is very silly to shut oneself into awardrobe, even if it is not a magic one.</p>
<p>那天下午，雨勢依舊沒有絲毫減弱的跡象，她們決定玩捉迷藏。蘇珊當“鬼”，其他人散開躲藏後，露西徑直走向衣櫃所在的房間。她並不打算躲進衣櫃，因為她知道只會讓其他人再提起那件糟糕的事。但她確實想再往裡面看一眼；因為這時她開始懷疑，納尼亞和牧神的故事是不是只是一場夢。房子又大又複雜，到處都是藏身之處，她想自己應該有時間往衣櫃裡看一眼，然後躲到別的地方去。但她剛走到衣櫥前，就聽到外面走廊傳來腳步聲，於是她別無選擇，只好跳進衣櫥，把門關上。她沒有把門關嚴實，因為她知道把自己關進衣櫥裡很傻，即使那不是魔法衣櫥。</p>
<p>Now the steps she had heard were those of Edmund;and he came into the room just in time to see Lucy vanishinginto the wardrobe.  He at once decided to get into ithimself—not because he thought it a particularly goodplace to hide but because he wanted to go on teasing herabout her imaginary country.  He opened the door.  Therewere the coats hanging up as usual, and a smell ofmothballs, and darkness and silence, and no sign of Lucy.  "Shethinks I'm Susan come to catch her," said Edmund tohimself, "and so she's keeping very quiet in at the back."  Hejumped in and shut the door, forgetting what a very foolishthing this is to do.  Then he began feeling about for Lucyin the dark.  He had expected to find her in a few secondsand was very surprised when he did not.  He decided toopen the door again and let in some light.  But he could notfind the door either.  He didn't like this at all and begangroping wildly in every direction; he even shouted out."Lucy!  Lu!  Where are you?  I know you're here."</p>
<p>她剛才聽到的腳步聲正是艾德蒙的；當他走進房間時，正好看見露西消失在衣櫥裡。他立刻決定自己也鑽進去──倒不是因為他覺得那是個特別好的藏身之處，而是因為他想繼續取笑她那虛構的國度。他打開衣櫥門。裡面像往常一樣掛著外套，瀰漫著樟腦丸的味道，一片漆黑寂靜，卻不見露西的蹤影。 「她以為我是蘇珊來抓她的，」艾德蒙自言自語道，「所以她躲在裡面悄無聲息的。」他跳進衣櫥，關上門，全然忘記了自己這麼做有多麼愚蠢。然後，他開始在黑暗中摸索尋找露西。他原本以為幾秒鐘就能找到她，結果卻一無所獲，這讓他大吃一驚。他決定再次打開衣櫥門，讓光線透進來。但他還是找不到門。他很不高興，開始胡亂地四處摸索；他甚至大聲喊叫起來。 “露西！露！你在哪裡？我知道你在這裡。”</p>
<p>There was no answer and Edmund noticed that his ownvoice had a curious sound—not the sound you expect in acupboard but a kind of open-air sound.  He alsonoticed that he was unexpectedly cold; and then he saw alight.</p>
<p>沒有回應，艾德蒙注意到自己的聲音有些奇怪——不是在衣櫥裡發出的那種聲音，而是一種在戶外發出的聲音。他還注意到自己出乎意料地冷；然後，他看到了一束光。</p>
<p>"Thank goodness," said Edmund, "the door must haveswung open of its own accord."  He forgot all about Lucyand went towards the light which he thought was the opendoor of the wardrobe.  But instead of finding himselfstepping out into the spare room he found himself stepping outfrom the shadow of some thick dark fir trees into an openplace in the middle of a wood.</p>
<p>「謝天謝地，」艾德蒙說，「門一定是自己打開的。」他把露西忘得一乾二淨，朝著他以為是衣櫥門的光亮走去。但他發現自己並沒有走進空房間，而是從幾棵茂密的黑杉樹的陰影中走出，來到了樹林中央的一片空地。</p>
<p>There was crisp, dry snow under his feet and more snowlying on the branches of the trees.  Overhead there was apale blue sky, the sort of sky one sees on a fine winter dayin the morning.  Straight ahead of him he saw between thetree trunks the sun, just rising, very red and clear.Everything was perfectly still, as if he were the only livingcreature in that country.  There was not even a robin or asquirrel among the trees, and the wood stretched as faras he could see in every direction.  He shivered.</p>
<p>腳下是清脆乾燥的積雪，樹枝上也覆蓋著厚厚的積雪。頭頂是淡藍色的天空，就像晴朗冬日清晨的天空。他看到正前方，太陽從樹幹間升起，鮮紅明亮。一切都靜得出奇，彷彿他是這片土地上唯一的生靈。樹林裡連一隻知更鳥或鬆鼠都找不到，目之所及，樹林一望無際。他打了個寒顫。</p>
<p>He now remembered that he had been looking forLucy; and also how unpleasant he had been to her abouther "imaginary country" which now turned out not tohave been imaginary at all.  He thought that she must besomewhere quite close and so he shouted, "Lucy!  Lucy!I'm here too—Edmund."</p>
<p>他這才想起自己一直在找露西；也想起自己之前對她「想像中的國度」有多麼不客氣，而現在看來，那國度根本不是想像出來的。他想她肯定就在附近，於是喊道：“露西！露西！我也在這兒——埃德蒙。”</p>
<p>There was no answer.</p>
<p>沒有回應。</p>
<p>"She's angry about all the things I've been sayinglately," thought Edmund.  And though he did not like toadmit that he had been wrong, he also did not much likebeing alone in this strange, cold, quiet place; so he shoutedagain.</p>
<p>「她肯定是因為我最近說的那些話生氣了，」艾德蒙心想。雖然他不願承認自己錯了，但也不喜歡獨自一人待在這個陌生、寒冷、寂靜的地方；於是他又喊了一聲。</p>
<p>"I say, Lu!  I'm sorry I didn't believe you.  I see now youwere right all along.  Do come out.  Make it Pax."</p>
<p>「我說，露！真抱歉我不相信你。現在看來，你一直都是對的。出來吧，讓帕克斯回來。”</p>
<p>Still there was no answer.</p>
<p>仍然沒有回應。</p>
<p>"Just like a girl," said Edmund to himself, "sulkingsomewhere, and won't accept an apology."  He lookedround him again and decided he did not much like thisplace, and had almost made up his mind to go home, whenhe heard, very far off in the wood, a sound of bells.  Helistened and the sound came nearer and nearer and at lastthere swept into sight a sledge drawn by two reindeer.</p>
<p>「真像個姑娘，」艾德蒙心想，「躲在某個地方生悶氣，不肯接受道歉。」他再次環顧四周，覺得不太喜歡這個地方，幾乎已經決定回家了。這時，他聽到遠處樹林傳來鈴鐺聲。他側耳傾聽，鈴聲越來越近，最後，一輛由兩頭馴鹿拉著的雪橇出現在眼前。</p>
<p>The reindeer were about the size of Shetland ponies andtheir hair was so white that even the snow hardly lookedwhite compared with them; their branching horns weregilded and shone like something on fire when the sunrisecaught them.  Their harness was of scarlet leather andcovered with bells.  On the sledge, driving the reindeer, sata fat dwarf who would have been about three feet high ifhe had been standing.  He was dressed in polar bear's furand on his head he wore a red hood with a long gold tasselhanging down from its point; his huge beard covered hisknees and served him instead of a rug.  But behind him, ona much higher seat in the middle of the sledge sat a verydifferent person—a great lady, taller than any woman thatEdmund had ever seen.  She also was covered in white furup to her throat and held a long straight golden wand inher right hand and wore a golden crown on her head.  Herface was white—not merely pale, but white like snow orpaper or icing sugar, except for her very red mouth.  It wasa beautiful face in other respects, but proud and cold andstern.</p>
<p>馴鹿體型和設得蘭矮種馬差不多，它們的毛髮潔白如雪，與它們相比，連雪都顯得黯然失色；它們分叉的鹿角鍍著金，在日出的照耀下閃閃發光，如同燃燒的火焰。它們的挽具是用猩紅色皮革製成的，上麵綴滿了鈴鐺。雪橇上，駕馭馴鹿的是一個肥胖的矮人，站起來大概有三英尺高。他身穿北極熊皮，頭戴一頂紅色兜帽，帽尖垂著一條長長的金流蘇；濃密的鬍鬚遮住了膝蓋，與其說是毯子，不如說是披肩。但在他身後，雪橇中央一個高得多的座位上，坐著一位截然不同的人——一位高大的女人，比埃德蒙見過的任何女人都要高。她也穿著白色的皮毛，一直延伸到脖子，右手握著一根長長的金色魔杖，頭上戴著一頂金冠。她的臉色蒼白——不僅僅是蒼白，而是像雪、紙或糖霜一樣白，只有嘴唇鮮紅。她的臉其他方面都很美麗，但卻驕傲、冷漠、嚴厲。</p>
<p>The sledge was a fine sight as it came sweeping towardsEdmund with the bells jingling and the Dwarf cracking hiswhip and the snow flying up on each side of it.</p>
<p>雪橇呼嘯著朝埃德蒙駛來，鈴鐺叮噹作響，矮人揮舞著鞭子，雪在雪橇兩側飛舞，景象十分壯觀。</p>
<p>"Stop!" said the Lady, and the Dwarf pulled thereindeer up so sharp that they almost sat down.  Then theyrecovered themselves and stood champing their bits andblowing.  In the frosty air the breath coming out of theirnostrils looked like smoke.</p>
<p>「停下來！」夫人喊道。矮人猛地拉起馴鹿，它們差點坐了下來。然後它們穩住身形，站起身來，咬著嚼子，呼出一口氣。在寒冷的空氣中，它們鼻孔裡呼出的氣息如同煙霧一般。</p>
<p>"And what, pray, are you?" said the Lady, looking hardat Edmund.</p>
<p>「請問，你是何人？」夫人目光銳利地打量著艾德蒙問道。</p>
<p>"I'm—I'm—my name's Edmund," said Edmund ratherawkwardly.  He did not like the way she looked at him.</p>
<p>「我……我……我叫艾德蒙，」艾德蒙有些尷尬地說。他不喜歡她看他的眼神。</p>
<p>The Lady frowned.  "Is that how you address a Queen?"she asked, looking sterner than ever.</p>
<p>夫人皺起了眉頭。 「你竟這樣稱呼一位女王？」她問道，神情比以往任何時候都更加嚴肅。</p>
<p>"I beg your pardon, your Majesty, I didn't know," saidEdmund.</p>
<p>「陛下，恕我冒昧，我不知道。」艾德蒙說。</p>
<p>"Not know the Queen of Narnia?" cried she.  "Ha!  Youshall know us better hereafter.  But I repeat—what areyou?"</p>
<p>「不知道納尼亞女王？」她驚呼。 “哈！以後你就會更了解我們了。但我再說一遍——你是什麼人？”</p>
<p>"Please, your Majesty," said Edmund, "I don't knowwhat you mean.  I'm at school—at least I was—it's theholidays now."</p>
<p>“陛下，請您別介意，”埃德蒙說道，“我不知道您是什麼意思。我在學校——至少之前在——現在是假期。”</p>
