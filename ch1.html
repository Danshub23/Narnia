<h3>CHAPTER I</h3>
<p>
    Once there were four children whose names were
Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy.  This story is
about something that happened to them when
they were sent away from London during the war because
of the air-raids.  They were sent to the house of an old
Professor who lived in the heart of the country, ten miles
from the nearest railway station and two miles from the
nearest post office.  He had no wife and he lived in a very
large house with a housekeeper called Mrs. Macready and
three servants.  (Their names were Ivy, Margaret and
Betty, but they do not come into the story much.)  He
himself was a very old man with shaggy white hair, which
grew over most of his face as well as on his head, and they
liked him almost at once; but on the first evening when he
came out to meet them at the front door he was so
odd-looking that Lucy (who was the youngest) was a little
afraid of him, and Edmund (who was the next youngest)
wanted to laugh and had to keep on pretending he was
blowing his nose to hide it.
</p>
<p>
    從前有四個孩子，名叫彼得、蘇珊、艾德蒙和露西。這個故事講述的是戰爭期間，
    由於空襲，他們被迫離開倫敦，來到一位老教授家。這位教授住在鄉下，
    離最近的火車站十英里，離最近的郵局兩英里。他沒有妻子，住在一棟很大的房子裡，
    家裡有一位名叫麥克雷迪太太的管家和三個僕人。 （她們的名字分別是艾薇、
    瑪格麗特和貝蒂，但她們在故事中出場不多。）教授本人是一位非常年邁的老人，
    滿頭蓬亂的白髮幾乎覆蓋了他的整張臉和整個頭部。孩子們幾乎立刻就喜歡上了他；
    但是，第一天晚上，當他出來在門口迎接他們時，他的樣子實在太古怪了，
    以至於最小的露西有點害怕他，而次小的埃德蒙則想笑，只好假裝擤鼻涕來掩飾。
</p>

<p>
As soon as they had said good night to the Professor and
gone upstairs on the first night, the boys came into the
girls' room and they all talked it over.
</p>
<p>第一晚，他們跟教授道了晚安，上樓後，男孩們就進了女孩們的房間，大家開始討論。</p>
<p>
"We've fallen on our feet and no mistake," said Peter.
"This is going to be perfectly splendid.  That old chap will
let us do anything we like."
</p>
<p>“我們真是走了狗屎運，”彼得說，“這簡直太棒了！那老頭子肯定會讓我們為所欲為。”</p>
<p>
"I think he's an old dear," said Susan.
</p>
<p>「我覺得他真是個老好人，」蘇珊說。</p>
<p>
"Oh, come off it!" said Edmund, who was tired and
pretending not to be tired, which always made him
bad-tempered.  "Don't go on talking like that."
</p>
<p>「哎呀，別這樣！」艾德蒙說道，他明明很累，卻裝作不累的樣子，這總是讓他脾氣暴躁。 “別再這樣說話了。”</p>
<p>
"Like what?" said Susan; "and anyway, it's time you
were in bed."
</p>
<p>“怎樣？”蘇珊問，“而且，你也該睡覺了。”</p>
<p>
"Trying to talk like Mother," said Edmund.  "And who
are you to say when I'm to go to bed?  Go to bed yourself."
</p>
<p>“你這是在模仿媽媽說話，”埃德蒙說，“你憑什麼管我什麼時候睡覺？你自己去睡覺吧。”</p>
<p>
"Hadn't we all better go to bed?" said Lucy.  "There's
sure to be a row if we're heard talking here."
</p>
<p>“我們是不是都該睡覺了？”露西說，“要是被人聽到我們在這裡說話，肯定會吵起來的。” </p>
<p>
"No there won't," said Peter.  "I tell you this is the sort
of house where no one's going to mind what we do.  Anyway,
they won't hear us.  It's about ten minutes' walk from
here down to that dining room, and any amount of stairs
and passages in between."
</p>
<p>
    「不會的，」彼得說。 「我跟你說，在這種房子裡，沒人會介意我們做什麼。反正他們也聽不見。
    從這裡走到餐廳大概要十分鐘，中間就算經過很多樓梯和走廊也沒關係。”
</p>
<p>
"What's that noise?" said Lucy suddenly.  It was a far
larger house than she had ever been in before and the
thought of all those long passages and rows of doors
leading into empty rooms was beginning to make her feel a
little creepy.
</p>
<p>
    「那是什麼聲音？」露西突然問。這房子比她以前住過的任何房子都大得多，
    想到那些長長的走廊和一排排通往空房間的門，她開始覺得有點毛骨悚然。
</p>

<p>
"It's only a bird, silly," said Edmund.
</p>
<p>
    「那隻是一隻鳥，傻瓜。」艾德蒙說。
</p>
<p>
"It's an owl," said Peter.  "This is going to be a wonderful
place for birds.  I shall go to bed now.  I say, let's go and
explore to-morrow.  You might find anything in a place
like this.  Did you see those mountains as we came along?
And the woods?  There might be eagles.  There might be
stags.  There'll be hawks."
</p>
<p>
    「那是一隻貓頭鷹。」彼得說。 「這裡對鳥兒來說真是個好地方。我該睡覺了。我說，
    我們明天去探險吧。在這種地方，什麼都可能發現。你看到我們剛才走過的那些山了嗎？
    還有樹林？那裡可能有老鷹，可能有雄鹿，肯定還有隼。”
</p>
<p>
"Badgers!" said Lucy.
</p>
<p>「獾！」露西說。</p>
<p>
"Snakes!" said Edmund.
</p>
<p>「蛇！」埃德蒙說。</p>
<p>
"Foxes!" said Susan.
</p>
<p>「狐狸！」蘇珊說。</p>
<p>
But when next morning came, there was a steady rain
falling, so thick that when you looked out of the window
you could see neither the mountains nor the woods nor
even the stream in the garden.
</p>
<p>
    但第二天早上，雨下個不停，雨勢之大，從窗戶望出去，既看不到山，也看不到樹林，甚至連花園裡的溪流也看不見了。
</p>
<p>
"Of course it <i>would</i> be raining!" said Edmund.  They
had just finished breakfast with the Professor and were
upstairs in the room he had set apart for them—a long,
low room with two windows looking out in one direction
and two in another.
</p>
<p>
    「當然會下雨！」埃德蒙說。他們剛和教授吃完早餐，正待在樓上教授專門為他們準備的房間裡——那是一間狹長的低矮房間，兩扇窗戶分別朝向不同的方向。
</p>
<p>
"Do stop grumbling, Ed," said Susan.  "Ten to one it'll
clear up in an hour or so.  And in the meantime we're
pretty well off.  There's a wireless and lots of books."
</p>
<p>“別抱怨了，埃德，”蘇珊說，“十有八九一個小時後就會停。而且這段時間我們過得挺好的。這裡有收音機，還有很多書。”</p>
<p>
"Not for me," said Peter, "I'm going to explore in the
house."
</p>
<p>“我才不要呢，”彼得說，“我要在屋裡四處逛逛。”</p>
<p>
Everyone agreed to this and that was how the adventures
began.  It was the sort of house that you never seem
to come to the end of, and it was full of unexpected places.
The first few doors they tried led only into spare
bedrooms, as everyone had expected that they would; but
soon they came to a very long room full of pictures and
there they found a suit of armour; and after that was a
room all hung with green, with a harp in one corner; and
then came three steps down and five steps up, and then a
kind of little upstairs hall and a door that led out onto a
balcony, and then a whole series of rooms that led into
each other and were lined with books—most of them very
old books and some bigger than a Bible in a church.  And
shortly after that they looked into a room that was quite
empty except for one big wardrobe; the sort that has a
looking-glass in the door.  There was nothing else in the
room at all except a dead blue-bottle on the window-sill.
</p>
<p>
    大家都同意了，冒險就此展開。這是一棟彷彿永遠走不到盡頭的房子，
    裡面充滿了意想不到的地方。正如大家所預料的那樣，他們嘗試打開的
    最初幾扇門都通向空置的臥室；但很快，他們就來到了一間掛滿畫作的
    長屋，在那裡發現了一套盔甲；之後是一個掛滿綠色掛飾的房間，角落裡
    放著一架豎琴；接著是三級台階下，五級台階上，然後是一個小小的樓上
    走廊，走廊盡頭有一扇通往陽台的門，之後是一連串彼此相連的房間，
    間裡擺滿了書籍——大部分都是古籍，有些比教堂裡的《聖經》還要大。
    不久之後，他們看到一個房間空空如也，只有一個大衣櫃；那種衣櫃門
    上裝著一面鏡子。房間裡除了窗台上死掉的一隻蒼蠅之外，什麼都沒有。
</p>
<p>
"Nothing there!" said Peter, and they all trooped out
again—all except Lucy.  She stayed behind because she
thought it would be worth while trying the door of the
wardrobe, even though she felt almost sure that it would
be locked.  To her surprise it opened quite easily, and two
moth-balls dropped out.
</p>
<p>
    「什麼都沒有！」彼得說，然後他們都走了出去——除了露西。她留了下來，
    因為她覺得值得一試衣櫃的門，儘管她幾乎可以肯定門是鎖著的。令她驚訝的是，
    門很容易就開了，掉了出兩顆樟腦丸。
</p>
<p>
Looking into the inside, she saw several coats hanging
up—mostly long fur coats.  There was nothing Lucy liked
so much as the smell and feel of fur.  She immediately
stepped into the wardrobe and got in among the coats and
rubbed her face against them, leaving the door open, of
course, because she knew that it is very foolish to shut
oneself into any wardrobe.  Soon she went further in and found
that there was a second row of coats hanging up behind
the first one.  It was almost quite dark in there and she
kept her arms stretched out in front of her so as not to
bump her face into the back of the wardrobe.  She took a
step further in—then two or three steps—always expecting
to feel woodwork against the tips of her fingers.  But she
could not feel it.
</p>
<p>
    她往衣櫃裡看了看，看到掛著幾件外套——大多是長長的皮草大衣。
    露西最喜歡的就是皮草的氣味和觸感。她立刻走進衣櫃，鑽進外套堆裡，
    把臉貼在皮草上蹭來蹭去，當然，她沒關門，因為她知道把自己關在衣櫃
    裡是很愚蠢的。很快，她又往裡面走了幾步，發現第一排外套後面還掛著
    第二排。裡面幾乎很黑，她伸直雙臂擋在身前，以免臉撞到衣櫃的後壁。
    她又往裡面走了一步——然後是兩三步——始終期待著指尖能碰到木頭。但她
    卻什麼也感覺不到。
</p>
<p>
"This must be a simply enormous wardrobe!" thought
Lucy, going still further in and pushing the soft folds of
the coats aside to make room for her.  Then she noticed
that there was something crunching under her feet.  "I
wonder is that more moth-balls?" she thought, stooping
down to feel it with her hands.  But instead of feeling the
hard, smooth wood of the floor of the wardrobe, she felt
something soft and powdery and extremely cold, "This
is very queer," she said, and went on a step or two further.
</p>
<p>
    「這衣櫃也太大了！」露西心想，一邊繼續往裡走，一邊撥開柔軟的衣褶
    ，騰出空間。這時，她注意到腳下有東西嘎吱作響。 「是不是樟腦丸？」
    她想著，彎下腰去摸。但她摸到的不是衣櫃底部堅硬光滑的木地板，而是
    一種柔軟、粉狀、冰涼的東西。 「真奇怪，」她說著，又往前走了一兩步。
</p>
<p>
Next moment she found that what was rubbing against
her face and hands was no longer soft fur but something
hard and rough and even prickly.  "Why, it is just like
branches of trees!" exclaimed Lucy.  And then she saw that
there was a light ahead of her; not a few inches away
where the back of the wardrobe ought to have been, but
a long way off.  Something cold and soft was falling on her.
A moment later she found that she was standing in the
middle of a wood at night-time with snow under her feet
and snowflakes falling through the air.
</p>
<p>
    下一刻，她發現蹭到她臉和手上的東西不再是柔軟的皮毛，而是堅硬、
    粗糙，甚至帶刺的東西。 「哎呀，這簡直就像樹枝！」露西驚呼道。然
    後，她看到前方有光亮；不是在衣櫃後壁幾英寸遠的地方，而是在很遠的
    地方。有什麼冰涼柔軟的東西落在了她身上。片刻之後，她發現自己站在
    一片夜色籠罩的樹林中央，腳下是皚皚白雪，雪花在空中飄落。
</p>
<p>
Lucy felt a little frightened, but she felt very inquisitive
and excited as well.  She looked back over her shoulder and
there, between the dark tree-trunks, she could still see the
open doorway of the wardrobe and even catch a glimpse
of the empty room from which she had set out.  (She had,
of course, left the door open, for she knew that it is a very
silly thing to shut oneself into a wardrobe.)  It seemed to
be still daylight there.  "I can always get back if anything
goes wrong," thought Lucy.  She began to walk forward,
<i>crunch-crunch</i>, over the snow and through the wood
towards the other light.
</p>
<p>
    露西感到有些害怕，但同時也充滿了好奇與興奮。她回頭望去，在兩棵黝黑的樹幹之間，
    她仍然能看到敞開的衣櫃門，甚至還能瞥見她出發的那間空蕩蕩的房間。 （當然，她把門開著，
    因為她知道把自己關進衣櫃裡是多麼愚蠢的事情。）那裡似乎還亮著燈。 「如果出了
    什麼事，我隨時可以回去，」露西心想。她開始向前走去，嘎吱嘎吱地踩著雪，穿過樹林，朝著另一束光走去。
</p>

<p>
In about ten minutes she reached it and found that it
was a lamp-post.  As she stood looking at it, wondering
why there was a lamp-post in the middle of a wood and
wondering what to do next, she heard a pitter patter of
feet coming towards her.  And soon after that a very strange
person stepped out from among the trees into the light of
the lamp-post.
</p>
<p>
    大約十分鐘後，她走到了路邊，發現那是一根路燈。她站在那裡看著路燈，
    納悶為什麼樹林中央會有一條路燈，也不知道接下來該怎麼辦。這時，她聽
    到一陣輕快的腳步聲朝她走來。緊接著，一個非常奇怪的人從樹叢中走了出來
    ，沐浴在路燈的光亮下。
</p>
<p>
He was only a little taller than Lucy herself and he
carried over his head an umbrella, white with snow.  From the
waist upwards he was like a man, but his legs were shaped
like a goat's (the hair on them was glossy black) and
instead of feet he had goat's hoofs.  He also had a tail, but
Lucy did not notice this at first because it was neatly
caught up over the arm that held the umbrella so as to
keep it from trailing in the snow.  He had a red woollen
muffler round his neck and his skin was rather reddish too.
He had a strange, but pleasant little face with a short
pointed beard and curly hair, and out of the hair there
stuck two horns, one on each side of his forehead.  One of
his hands, as I have said, held the umbrella: in the other
arm he carried several brown paper parcels.  What with
the parcels and the snow it looked just as if he had been
doing his Christmas shopping.  He was a Faun.  And when
he saw Lucy he gave such a start of surprise that he
dropped all his parcels.
</p>
<p>
    他比露西略高一些，頭上撐著一把雪白的傘。腰部以上像個人，但
    腿卻像山羊腿（腿毛烏黑亮麗），腳也是山羊蹄。他還有一條尾巴，
    但露西一開始並沒有註意到，因為尾巴整齊地搭在撐傘的手臂上，不
    至於拖在雪地裡。他脖子上圍著一條紅色的羊毛圍巾，皮膚也略帶紅色
    。他長著一張奇特卻又討人喜歡的小臉，留著短短的尖鬍子和捲曲的頭
    髮，額頭兩側各長著一隻角。正如我之前所說，他一隻手撐著傘，另一
    隻手臂裡抱著幾個棕色的紙包裹。包裹加上雪景，看起來就像他剛買完聖
    誕禮物一樣。他是個半人半羊的牧神。當他看到露西時，嚇得魂飛魄散，
    手上的包裹全都掉了。
</p>
<p>
"Goodness gracious me!" exclaimed the Faun.
</p>
<p>「我的天！」牧神驚呼。</p>
