CHAPTER VI

<i>Into the Forest</i>
</h4>
<i>Back on This Side of the Door</i>
</h4>
<p>"I wish the Macready would hurry up and take allthese people away," said Susan presently, "I'mgetting horribly cramped."</p>
<p>“真希望麥克雷迪快點把這些人都帶走，”蘇珊過了一會兒說道，“我快被擠死了。”</p>
<p>"And what a filthy smell of camphor!" said Edmund.</p>
<p>「這樟腦味兒真難聞！」艾德蒙說。</p>
<p>"I expect the pockets of these coats are full of it," saidSusan, "to keep away moths."</p>
<p>“我猜這些外套口袋裡都裝滿了樟腦，”蘇珊說，“是為了防蛀。”</p>
<p>"There's something sticking into my back," said Peter.</p>
<p>「有東西扎到我背上了，」彼得說。</p>
<p>"And isn't it cold?" said Susan.</p>
<p>「是不是冷啊？」蘇珊問。</p>
<p>"Now that you mention it, it is cold," said Peter, "andhang it all, it's wet too.  What's the matter with this place?I'm sitting on something wet.  It's getting wetter everyminute."  He struggled to his feet.</p>
<p>「你這麼一說，確實冷，」彼得說，「而且，更糟的是，還濕漉漉的。這地方怎麼回事？我坐在濕漉漉的東西上，而且越來越濕了。」他掙扎著站了起來。</p>
<p>"Let's get out," said Edmund, "they've gone."</p>
<p>“我們走吧，”埃德蒙說，“他們走了。”</p>
<p>"O-o-oh!" said Susan suddenly.  And everyone asked herwhat was the matter.</p>
<p>「喔——喔——！」蘇珊突然叫了一聲。大家都問她怎麼了。</p>
<p>"I'm sitting against a tree," said Susan, "and look!  It'sgetting lighter—over there."</p>
<p>“我正靠著一棵樹坐著，”蘇珊說，“你看！天亮了——在那邊。”</p>
<p>"By jove, you're right," said Peter, "and look there—andthere.  It's trees all round.  And this wet stuff is snow.Why, I do believe we've got into Lucy's wood after all."</p>
<p>“天哪，你說得對，”彼得說，“你看那邊——還有那邊。周圍全是樹。這些濕漉漉的東西是雪。哎呀，看來我們果然進了露西的樹林。”</p>
<p>And now there was no mistaking it and all four childrenstood blinking in the daylight of a winter day.  Behind themwere coats hanging on pegs, in front of them weresnow-covered trees.</p>
<p>現在一切都確定無疑了，四個孩子都站在冬天的陽光下，眨著眼睛。他們身後掛著掛在衣鉤上的外套，眼前是白雪皚皚的樹木。</p>
<p>Peter turned at once to Lucy.</p>
<p>彼得立刻轉向露西。</p>
<p>"I apologise for not believing you," he said, "I'm sorry.Will you shake hands?"</p>
<p>“我真抱歉之前不相信你，”他說，“對不起。你願意和我握個手嗎？”</p>
<p>"Of course," said Lucy, and did.</p>
<p>「當然願意，」露西說著，握住了我的手。</p>
<p>"And now," said Susan, "what do we do next?"</p>
<p>“那麼，”蘇珊說，“我們接下來做什麼？”</p>
<p>"Do?" said Peter, "why, go and explore the wood, ofcourse."</p>
<p>“做什麼？”彼得說，“當然是去探索樹林啦。”</p>
<p>"Ugh!" said Susan, stamping her feet, "it's pretty cold.What about putting on some of these coats?"</p>
<p>“哎呀！”蘇珊跺著腳說：“真冷啊。要不穿上這些外套？”</p>
<p>"They're not ours," said Peter doubtfully.</p>
<p>「這些不是我們的。」彼得疑惑地說。</p>
<p>"I am sure nobody would mind," said Susan.  "It isn't asif we wanted to take them out of the house; we shan't takethem even out of the wardrobe."</p>
<p>“我想沒人會介意的。”蘇珊說，“又不是要把它們帶出屋子；我們連衣櫃都不會拿出來。”</p>
<p>"I never thought of that, Su," said Peter.  "Of course,now you put it that way, I see.  No one could say you hadbagged a coat as long as you leave it in the wardrobe whereyou found it.  And I suppose this whole country is in thewardrobe."</p>
<p>“我怎麼沒想到呢，蘇。”彼得說，“你這麼一說，我明白了。只要把外套放回衣櫃裡，就沒人能說你偷了一件。我想，整個國家都藏在衣櫃裡吧。”</p>
<p>They immediately carried out Susan's very sensibleplan.  The coats were rather too big for them so that theycame down to their heels and looked more like royal robesthan coats when they had put them on.  But they all felt agood deal warmer and each thought the others looked betterin their new get-up and more suitable to the landscape.</p>
<p>他們立刻執行了蘇珊這個非常明智的計畫。這些外套對他們來說有點太大了，都垂到腳跟了，穿上之後看起來更像是皇家長袍而不是外套。但他們都覺得暖和多了，而且都覺得彼此穿上新衣服更好看，也更符合周圍的景色。</p>
<p>"We can pretend we are Arctic explorers," said Lucy.</p>
<p>「我們可以假裝自己是北極探險家，」露西說。</p>
<p>"This is going to be exciting enough without anypretending," said Peter, as he began leading the way forwardinto the forest.  There were heavy darkish clouds overheadand it looked as if there might be more snow beforenight.</p>
<p>「不用假裝，這就已經夠刺激的了，」彼得說著，帶頭走進了森林。頭頂上烏雲密布，看起來天黑前還會下雪。</p>
<p>"I say," began Edmund presently, "oughtn't we to bebearing a bit more to the left, that is, if we are aiming forthe lamp-post."  He had forgotten for the moment that hemust pretend never to have been in the wood before.  Themoment the words were out of his mouth he realised thathe had given himself away.  Everyone stopped; everyonestared at him.  Peter whistled.</p>
<p>「我說，」艾德蒙過了一會兒開口，「如果我們要去路燈柱那裡，是不是應該再往左邊走一點？」他一時忘了自己必須假裝以前從未進過這片森林。話一出口，他就意識到自己露餡了。所有人都停了下來，盯著他看。彼得吹了聲口哨。</p>
<p>"So you really were here," he said, "that time Lu saidshe'd met you in here—and you made out she was tellinglies."</p>
<p>“所以你真的來過這裡，”他說，“露西說她在這裡見過你——而你卻說她在撒謊。”</p>
<p>There was a dead silence.  "Well, of all the poisonouslittle beasts—" said Peter and shrugged his shoulders andsaid no more.  There seemed, indeed, no more to say andpresently the four resumed their journey; but Edmundwas saying to himself, "I'll pay you all out for this, youpack of stuck-up, self-satisfied prigs."</p>
<p>一片死寂。 「唉，這麼多毒蛇——」彼得聳了聳肩，沒再說話。似乎確實沒什麼好說的了，四人很快繼續他們的旅程；但埃德蒙心裡卻想著：“我一定要好好教訓你們這些自以為是、沾沾自喜的偽君子。”</p>
<p>"Where <i>are</i> we going anyway?" said Susan, chiefly forthe sake of changing the subject.</p>
<p>「我們到底要去哪裡？」蘇珊問道，主要是為了轉移話題。</p>
<p>"I think Lu ought to be the leader," said Peter, "goodnessknows she deserves it.  Where will you take us, Lu?"</p>
<p>“我覺得露應該帶路，”彼得說，“她絕對配得上。露，你帶我們去哪裡？”</p>
<p>"What about going to see Mr. Tumnus?" said Lucy."He's the nice Faun I told you about."</p>
<p>“不如去見圖姆努斯先生？”露西說，“他就是我跟你們說過的那個和藹的半人半羊的牧神。”</p>
<p>Everyone agreed to this and off they went, walkingbriskly and stamping their feet.  Lucy proved a good leader.At first she wondered whether she would be able to findthe way, but she recognised an odd-looking tree in oneplace and a stump in another and brought them on towhere the ground became uneven and into the little valleyand at last to the very door of Mr. Tumnus' cave.  Butthere a terrible surprise awaited them.</p>
<p>大家都同意了，於是他們便出發了，腳步輕快，跺著腳。露西果然是個好領隊。起初她還擔心自己能不能找到路，但她認出了一棵奇特的樹，又認出了另一個地方的樹樁，便帶著大家來到了地勢崎嶇的地方，進入了小山谷，最後來到了圖姆努斯先生的洞穴門口。然而，一個可怕的景象正等著他們。</p>
<p>The door had been wrenched off its hinges and brokento bits.  Inside, the cave was dark and cold and had thedamp feel and smell of a place that had not been lived infor several days.  Snow had drifted in from the doorwayand was heaped on the floor, mixed with something black,which turned out to be the charred sticks and ashes fromthe fire.  Someone had apparently flung it about the roomand then stamped it out.  The crockery lay smashed on thefloor and the picture of the Faun's father had been slashedinto shreds with a knife.</p>
<p>洞門被人從門框上扯了下來，摔得粉碎。洞穴裡又黑又冷，潮濕陰冷，散發著好幾天無人居住的氣息。雪從門口飄進來，堆積在地板上，混雜著一些黑色的東西，原來是燒焦的樹枝和爐灰。顯然有人把它們丟得到處都是，然後踩滅了。陶器摔得粉碎，羊人父親的畫像也被刀子劃成了碎片。</p>
<p>"This is a pretty good wash-out," said Edmund, "notmuch good coming here."</p>
<p>“這地方真是糟透了，”埃德蒙說，“來這裡也沒什麼用。”</p>
<p>"What's this?" said Peter, stooping down.  He had justnoticed a piece of paper which had been nailed throughthe carpet to the floor.</p>
<p>「這是什麼？」彼得彎下腰問。他剛才注意到一張紙，釘在地毯上，一直釘在地板上。</p>
<p>"Is there anything written on it?" asked Susan.</p>
<p>「上面寫著什麼嗎？」蘇珊問。</p>
<p>"Yes, I think there is," answered Peter, "but I can'tread it in this light.  Let's get out into the open air."</p>
<p>“是的，我想是寫著的，”彼得回答，“不過光線這麼暗，我看不清。咱們出去透透氣吧。”</p>
<p>They all went out in the daylight and crowded roundPeter as he read out the following words:—</p>
<p>他們都走到外面，沐浴著陽光，圍在彼得身邊，聽他念出紙上的字：——</p>
<p class="noindent">"The former occupant of these premises, the FaunTumnus, is under arrest and awaiting his trial on acharge of High Treason against her Imperial MajestyJadis, Queen of Narnia, Chatelaine of Cair Paravel,Empress of the Lone Islands, etc., also of comfortingher said Majesty's enemies, harbouring spies andfraternising with Humans.</p>
