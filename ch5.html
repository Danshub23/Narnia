CHAPTER V
</h3>

<h4>
<i>Back on This Side of the Door</i>
</h4>
<p>Because the game of hide-and-seek was still goingon, it took Edmund and Lucy some time to find theothers.  But when at last they were all together(which happened in the long room, where the suit ofarmour was) Lucy burst out,</p>
<p>因為捉迷藏遊戲還在繼續，艾德蒙和露西花了好一會兒才找到其他人。但當他們終於聚齊時（就在擺放著盔甲的長房間裡），露西突然喊道：</p>
<p>"Peter!  Susan!  It's all true.  Edmund has seen it too.There is a country you can get to through the wardrobe.Edmund and I both got in.  We met one another in there,in the wood.  Go on, Edmund; tell them all about it."</p>
<p>「彼得！蘇珊！都是真的。埃德蒙也看到了。有一個國家可以通過衣櫥進去。我和埃德蒙都進去了。我們在裡面，在樹林里相遇了。快說，埃德蒙，把一切都告訴他們。”</p>
<p>"What's all this about, Ed?" said Peter.</p>
<p>「這到底是怎麼回事，艾德？」彼得問。</p>
<p>And now we come to one of the nastiest things in thisstory.  Up to that moment Edmund had been feeling sick,and sulky, and annoyed with Lucy for being right, but hehadn't made up his mind what to do.  When Peter suddenlyasked him the question he decided all at once to do themeanest and most spiteful thing he could think of.  Hedecided to let Lucy down.</p>
<p>現在，我們要講到故事裡最令人不快的事情之一了。在此之前，艾德蒙一直感到不舒服，悶悶不樂，而且因為露西說對了而生氣，但他還沒想好該怎麼辦。當彼得突然問他這個問題時，他立刻決定去做他能想到的最卑鄙、最惡毒的事情。他決定讓露西失望。</p>
<p>"Tell us, Ed," said Susan.</p>
<p>「說吧，艾德，」蘇珊說。</p>
<p>And Edmund gave a very superior look as if he werefar older than Lucy (there was really only a year'sdifference) and then a little snigger and said, "Oh, yes, Lucyand I have been playing—pretending that all her storyabout a country in the wardrobe is true.  Just for fun, ofcourse.  There's nothing there really."</p>
<p>埃德蒙擺出一副高人一等的姿態，彷彿他比露西年長許多（其實他們只相差一歲），然後輕笑一聲，說道：“哦，是的，露西和我一直在玩——假裝她講的衣櫥裡有個國家的故事都是真的。當然，只是為了好玩。那裡其實什麼也沒有。”</p>
<p>Poor Lucy gave Edmund one look and rushed out of the room.</p>
<p>可憐的露西看了埃德蒙一眼，就衝出了房間。</p>
<p>Edmund, who was becoming a nastier person everyminute, thought that he had scored a great success, andwent on at once to say, "There she goes again.  What's thematter with her?  That's the worst of young kids, theyalways—"</p>
<p>艾德蒙每分鐘都變得更加刻薄，他覺得自己大獲全勝，立刻說道：“她又來了。她怎麼了？小孩子最討厭的就是這個，總是——”</p>
<p>"Look here," said Peter turning on him savagely, "shutup!  You've been perfectly beastly to Lu ever since shestarted this nonsense about the wardrobe and now you goplaying games with her about it and setting her off again.I believe you did it simply out of spite."</p>
<p>「聽著，」彼得惡狠狠地瞪著他，「閉嘴！自從露露開始胡鬧衣櫥的事，你就一直對她很惡劣，現在你又拿這件事跟她玩，讓她再次生氣。我相信你純粹是出於惡意。”</p>
<p>"But it's all nonsense," said Edmund, very taken aback.</p>
<p>「但這一切都是胡鬧啊，」艾德蒙大吃一驚，說道。</p>
<p>"Of course it's all nonsense," said Peter, "that's just thepoint.  Lu was perfectly all right when we left home, butsince we've been down here she seems to be either goingqueer in the head or else turning into a most frightful liar.But whichever it is, what good do you think you'll do byjeering and nagging at her one day and encouraging herthe next?"</p>
<p>「當然都是胡說八道，」彼得說，「這正是問題的關鍵。露西離開家的時候還好好的，可自從我們來到這裡，她要么是腦子有點問題，要么就是變成了一個可怕的騙子。不管怎樣，你覺得今天嘲笑她、明天又鼓勵她，有什麼用呢？”</p>
<p>"I thought—I thought," said Edmund; but he couldn'tthink of anything to say.</p>
<p>「我以為——我以為，」艾德蒙說；但他想不出該說什麼。</p>
<p>"You didn't think anything at all," said Peter, "it's justspite.  You've always liked being beastly to anyone smallerthan yourself; we've seen that at school before now."</p>
<p>“你根本就沒想那麼多，”彼得說，“你只是在故意刁難。你一直都喜歡欺負比你弱小的人；我們在學校就見識過了。”</p>
<p>"Do stop it," said Susan; "it won't make things anybetter having a row between you two.  Let's go and find Lucy."</p>
<p>“別吵了，”蘇珊說，“你們倆吵架只會讓事情更糟。我們去找露西吧。”</p>
<p>It was not surprising that when they found Lucy, a gooddeal later, everyone could see that she had been crying.Nothing they could say to her made any difference.  Shestuck to her story and said:</p>
<p>不出所料，過了好一會兒他們才找到露西，大家都看得出來她哭過。他們跟她說什麼都沒用。她堅持自己的說法，說：</p>
<p>"I don't care what you think, and I don't care what yousay.  You can tell the Professor or you can write to Motheror you can do anything you like.  I know I've met a Faunin there and—I wish I'd stayed there and you are allbeasts, beasts."</p>
<p>「我不在乎你們怎麼想，也不在乎你們怎麼說。你們可以告訴教授，也可以寫信給媽媽，或者你們想做什麼都行。我知道我在那裡遇到了一個半人半羊的牧神，而且——我真希望我當時就待在那裡，你們都是野獸，野獸。”</p>
<p>It was an unpleasant evening.  Lucy was miserable andEdmund was beginning to feel that his plan wasn't workingas well as he had expected.  The two older ones were reallybeginning to think that Lucy was out of her mind.  Theystood in the passage talking about it in whispers longafter she had gone to bed.</p>
<p>那是一個令人不快的夜晚。露西很痛苦，艾德蒙開始覺得他的計畫並沒有像他預想的那樣順利。兩個大孩子真的開始覺得露西瘋了。在她上床睡覺很久之後，他們仍然站在走廊上低聲議論著這件事。</p>
<p>The result was that next morning they decided that theyreally would go and tell the whole thing to the Professor."He'll write to Father if he thinks there is really somethingwrong with Lu," said Peter; "it's getting beyond us."  Sothey went and knocked at the study door, and theProfessor said "Come in," and got up and found chairs forthem and said he was quite at their disposal.  Then he satlistening to them with the tips of his fingers pressedtogether and never interrupting, till they had finished thewhole story.  After that he said nothing for quite a longtime.  Then he cleared his throat and said the last thingeither of them expected.</p>
<p>結果是，第二天早上，他們決定真的要把整件事告訴教授。 「如果他覺得露西真的有什麼問題，他會寫信給爸爸的，」彼得說，「這事已經超出我們的能力範圍了。」於是他們去敲了敲書房的門，教授說：「進來吧。」然後起身給他們找了椅子，說他隨時聽候差遣。接著，他便坐下，手指輕輕併攏，靜靜地聽他們講述，一言不發，直到他們講完為止。之後，他沉默了許久。然後，他清了清嗓子，說出了他們兩個都意想不到的話。</p>
<p>"How do you know?" he asked, "that your sister's storyis not true?"</p>
<p>“你們怎麼知道？”他問道，“你們妹妹的故事不是真的？”</p>
<p>"Oh, but—" began Susan, and then stopped.  Anyonecould see from the old man's face that he was perfectlyserious.  Then Susan pulled herself together and said, "ButEdmund said they had only been pretending."</p>
<p>「哦，可是──」蘇珊剛開口，就停住了。從老人的表情就能看出，他是認真的。蘇珊這才鎮定下來，說：“可是埃德蒙說他們只是在演戲。”</p>
<p>"That is a point," said the Professor, "which certainlydeserves consideration; very careful consideration.  Forinstance—if you will excuse me for asking the question—doesyour experience lead you to regard your brother oryour sister as the more reliable?  I mean, which is the moretruthful?"</p>
<p>「這一點，」教授說，「確實值得深思；非常值得深思。例如——恕我冒昧——根據你們的經驗，你們覺得你們的哥哥還是妹妹更可靠？我的意思是，誰更誠實？”</p>
<p>"That's just the funny thing about it, Sir," said Peter."Up till now, I'd have said Lucy every time."</p>
<p>“先生，這事兒真有意思，”彼得說，“以前我每次都會說是露西。”</p>
<p>"And what do you think, my dear?" said the Professor,turning to Susan.</p>
<p>「那你怎麼看，親愛的？」教授轉向蘇珊問道。</p>
<p>"Well," said Susan, "in general, I'd say the same asPeter, but this couldn't be true—all this about the woodand the Faun."</p>
<p>“嗯，”蘇珊說，“一般來說，我會和彼得說的一樣，但這不可能是真的——關於樹林和牧神的一切。”</p>
<p>"That is more than I know," said the Professor, "and acharge of lying against someone whom you have alwaysfound truthful is a very serious thing; a very serious thingindeed."</p>
<p>“這超出了我的認知範圍，”教授說，“指控一個你一直認為誠實的人撒謊，可不是一件小事；確實是一件非常嚴重的事情。”</p>
<p>"We were afraid it mightn't even be lying," said Susan."We thought there might be something wrong with Lucy."</p>
<p>“我們擔心她可能根本沒有撒謊，”蘇珊說，“我們覺得露西可能有點問題。”</p>
<p>"Madness, you mean?" said the Professor quite coolly."Oh, you can make your minds easy about that.  One hasonly to look at her and talk to her to see that she is notmad."</p>
<p>“你是說瘋了？”教授語氣平靜地說，“哦，你們可以放心了。只要看看她，跟她聊聊，就知道她沒瘋。”</p>
<p>"But then," said Susan and stopped.  She had neverdreamed that a grown-up would talk like the Professorand didn't know what to think.</p>
<p>「可是……」蘇珊說著就停住了。她做夢也沒想到一個大人會像教授這樣說話，一時不知該作何感想。</p>
<p>"Logic!" said the Professor half to himself.  "Why don'tthey teach logic at these schools?  There are only threepossibilities.  Either your sister is telling lies, or she is mad, orshe is telling the truth.  You know she doesn't tell lies and itis obvious that she is not mad.  For the moment then andunless any further evidence turns up, we must assume thatshe is telling the truth."</p>
<p>“邏輯！”教授自言自語道，“為什麼這些學校不教邏輯呢？只有三種可能。要么你妹妹在撒謊，要么她瘋了，要么她說的是真話。你知道她不會撒謊，而且很明顯她也沒瘋。所以，在找到其他證據之前，我們暫時只能假設她說的是真話。”</p>
<p>Susan looked at him very hard and was quite sure fromthe expression on his face that he was not making fun of them.</p>
<p>蘇珊仔細地看著他，從他的表情來看，她確信他不是在嘲笑她們。</p>
<p>"But how could it be true, Sir?" said Peter.</p>
<p>「可是，先生，這怎麼可能是真的呢？」彼得說。</p>
<p>"Why do you say that?" asked the Professor.</p>
<p>「為什麼這麼說？」教授問。</p>
<p>"Well, for one thing," said Peter, "if it was real whydoesn't everyone find this country every time they go to thewardrobe?  I mean, there was nothing there when welooked; even Lucy didn't pretend there was."</p>
<p>“嗯，首先，”彼得說，“如果這是真的，為什麼每個人每次去衣櫥都能找到這個地方呢？我的意思是，我們找的時候什麼也沒有；就連露西也沒假裝那裡有。”</p>
<p>"What has that to do with it?" said the Professor.</p>
<p>「這跟這件事有什麼關係？」教授說。</p>
<p>"Well, Sir, if things are real, they're there all the time."</p>
<p>“嗯，先生，如果東西是真的，它們就一直都在那裡。”</p>
<p>"Are they?" said the Professor; and Peter did not knowquite what to say.</p>
<p>「是嗎？」教授說；彼得一時語塞。</p>
<p>"But there was no time," said Susan, "Lucy had had notime to have gone anywhere, even if there was such aplace.  She came running after us the very moment we wereout of the room.  It was less than a minute, and shepretended to have been away for hours."</p>
<p>“可是根本沒有時間，”蘇珊說，“露西根本沒時間去任何地方，就算真有這麼個地方。我們剛一出房間，她就追了過來。不到一分鐘，她卻裝作離開好幾個小時。”</p>
<p>"That is the very thing that makes her story so likely tobe true," said the Professor.  "If there really is a door inthis house that leads to some other world (and I shouldwarn you that this is a very strange house, and even I knowvery little about it)—if, I say, she had got into anotherworld, I should not be at all surprised to find that thatother world had a separate time of its own; so thathowever long you stayed there it would never take up any ofour time.  On the other hand, I don't think many girls ofher age would invent that idea for themselves.  If she hadbeen pretending, she would have hidden for a reasonabletime before coming out and telling her story."</p>
<p>「正因為如此，她的故事更有可能是真的，」教授說。 「如果這房子裡真的有一扇門通往另一個世界（我得提醒你，這房子很奇特，連我都知之甚少）——我說，如果她真的去了另一個世界，我一點也不奇怪那個世界會有自己的時間；所以無論你在那裡待多久，都不會佔用我們的時間。另一方面，我覺得像她這個年紀的女孩不太可能自己編造出這種想法。</p>
<p>"But do you really mean, Sir," said Peter, "that therecould be other worlds—all over the place, just round thecorner—like that?"</p>
<p>“可是，先生，”彼得說，“您真的認為會有其他世界——到處都是，就在拐角處——像這樣？”</p>
<p>"Nothing is more probable," said the Professor, takingoff his spectacles and beginning to polish them, while hemuttered to himself, "I wonder what they do teach them atthese schools."</p>
<p>“這完全有可能，”教授一邊說著，一邊摘下眼鏡擦拭，嘴裡還嘟囔著：“我真想知道這些學校都教些什麼。”</p>
<p>"But what are we to do?" said Susan.  She felt that theconversation was beginning to get off the point.</p>
<p>「可是我們該怎麼辦？」蘇珊說。她覺得談話開始偏離主題了。</p>
<p>"My dear young lady," said the Professor, suddenlylooking up with a very sharp expression at both of them,"there is one plan which no one has yet suggested andwhich is well worth trying."</p>
<p>“親愛的小姐，”教授突然抬起頭，目光銳利地掃過她們倆，“有一個方案至今無人提及，但非常值得一試。”</p>
<p>"What's that?" said Susan.</p>
<p>「什麼方案？」蘇珊問。</p>
<p>"We might all try minding our own business," said he.And that was the end of that conversation.</p>
<p>「我們最好都管好自己的事，」他說。談話就此結束。</p>
<p>After this things were a good deal better for Lucy.  Petersaw to it that Edmund stopped jeering at her, and neithershe nor anyone else felt inclined to talk about the wardrobeat all.  It had become a rather alarming subject.  Andso for a time it looked as if all the adventures were comingto an end; but that was not to be.</p>
<p>此後，露西的處境好轉了很多。彼得讓艾德蒙不再嘲笑她，她和其他人也不願再提起衣櫥的事。那已經變成了一個相當令人不安的話題。因此，一度看來所有的冒險似乎都即將結束；但事實並非如此。</p>
<p>This house of the Professor's—which even he knew solittle about—was so old and famous that people from allover England used to come and ask permission to see overit.  It was the sort of house that is mentioned in guide booksand even in histories; and well it might be, for all mannerof stories were told about it, some of them even strangerthan the one I am telling you now.  And when parties ofsight-seers arrived and asked to see the house, the Professoralways gave them permission, and Mrs. Macready, thehousekeeper, showed them round, telling them about thepictures and the armour, and the rare books in the library.Mrs. Macready was not fond of children, and did not liketo be interrupted when she was telling visitors all the thingsshe knew.  She had said to Susan and Peter almost on thefirst morning (along with a good many other instructions)"And please remember you're to keep out of the waywhenever I'm taking a party over the house."</p>
<p>教授的這棟房子——就連他自己也知之甚少——歷史悠久，名聲顯赫，以至於來自英格蘭各地的人們都慕名而來，請求參觀。這棟房子經常出現在旅遊指南甚至歷史著作中；它名不虛傳，因為關於它流傳著各種各樣的故事，其中一些甚至比我現在講的還要離奇。每當有遊客前來參觀，教授總是欣然應允，管家麥克雷迪太太便會熱情地接待他們，向他們介紹畫作、盔甲以及圖書館裡的珍稀書籍。麥克雷迪太太不喜歡小孩，也不喜歡在她滔滔不絕地講述自己所知道的一切時被打斷。幾乎在第一天早上，她就對蘇珊和彼得叮囑道（當然，她還叮囑了一大堆其他的事情）：“記住，我帶人來家裡的時候，你們都別礙事。”</p>
<p>"Just as if any of us would want to waste half themorning trailing round with a crowd of strange grown-ups!"said Edmund, and the other three thought the same.  Thatwas how the adventures began for the second time.</p>
<p>「誰會想浪費半個上午的時間跟一群陌生的大人到處晃悠呢！」艾德蒙說道，其他三個孩子也這麼想。就這樣，他們的第二次冒險開始了。</p>
<p>A few mornings later Peter and Edmund were lookingat the suit of armour and wondering if they could take it tobits when the two girls rushed into the room and said,"Look out!  Here comes the Macready and a whole gangwith her."</p>
<p>幾天後的早晨，彼得和艾德蒙正在研究那套盔甲，琢磨著能不能把它拆開。這時，兩個女孩衝進房間，喊道：“小心！麥克雷迪太太帶著一大幫人來了！”</p>
<p>"Sharp's the word," said Peter, and all four made offthrough the door at the far end of the room.  But whenthey had got out into the Green Room and beyond it, intothe library, they suddenly heard voices ahead of them, andrealised that Mrs. Macready must be bringing her partyof sight-seers up the back stairs—instead of up the frontstairs as they had expected.  And after that—whether itwas that they lost their heads, or that Mrs. Macready wastrying to catch them, or that some magic in the house hadcome to life and was chasing them into Narnia—theyseemed to find themselves being followed everywhere,until at last Susan said, "Oh bother those trippers!Here—let's get into the Wardrobe Room till they've passed.  Noone will follow us in there."  But the moment they wereinside they heard voices in the passage—and thensomeone fumbling at the door—and then they saw the handleturning.</p>
<p>「快跑！」彼得說。四個人立刻從房間另一頭的門溜走了。但當他們走出房間，來到綠廳，又穿過綠廳來到圖書館時，突然聽到前方傳來人聲，這才意識到麥克雷迪太太一定是帶著她的那群遊客從後樓梯上來——而不是像他們預想的那樣從前樓梯上來。之後——不知是他們失去了理智，還是麥克雷迪太太想抓住他們，又或許是房子裡的某種魔法突然發作，正追著他們進入納尼亞——他們似乎發現自己無論走到哪裡都被人跟踪，直到最後蘇珊說道：“哎呀，別理那些傢伙！來，我們去衣櫥裡，等他們過去。裡面沒人會看到我們。”可他們剛一進門走廊，就有人摸著門走廊——然後就有人打開了門走廊。</p>
<p>"Quick!" said Peter, "there's nowhere else," and flungopen the wardrobe.  All four of them bundled inside it andsat there, panting, in the dark.  Peter held the door closedbut did not shut it; for, of course, he remembered, as everysensible person does, that you should never never shutyourself up in a wardrobe.</p>
<p>「快！」彼得說，「沒別的地方可去了，」說著，他猛地拉開衣櫥的門。四個人都擠了進去，坐在黑暗中，氣喘吁籲。彼得把門扶在旁邊，但沒有關上；因為他當然記得，就像每個明智的人一樣，你永遠不應該把自己關在衣櫃裡。</p>
two hills.  So next timeyou come you have only to find the lamp-post and lookfor those two hills and walk through the wood till you reachmy house.  You had better keep the river on your rightwhen you get to it.  But remember—you must bring theothers with you.  I might have to be very angry with youif you came alone."</p>
<p>「嗯，我的房子就在這兩座小山中間。所以下次你來的時候，只要找到路燈，再找到那兩座小山，穿過樹林就能到我家了。到了之後，最好讓河在你的右邊。不過記住——你必須帶上其他人。如果你一個人來，我可能會很生氣。」</p>
<p>"I'll do my best," said Edmund.</p>
<p>「我會盡力的，」艾德蒙說。</p>
<p>"And, by the way," said the Queen, "you needn't tellthem about me.  It would be fun to keep it a secret betweenus two, wouldn't it?  Make it a surprise for them.  Justbring them along to the two hills—a clever boy like youwill easily think of some excuse for doing that—and whenyou come to my house you could just say 'Let's see wholives here' or something like that.  I am sure that would bebest.  If your sister has met one of the Fauns, she may haveheard strange stories about me—nasty stories that mightmake her afraid to come to me.  Fauns will say anything,you know, and now—"</p>
<p>「對了，」王后說，「你不用告訴他們我的事。我們倆保守這個秘密豈不是很有趣？給他們一個驚喜。帶他們去那兩座小山上——像你這麼聰明的孩子，肯定能想出個藉口——等你們到了我家，就說『咱們去看看誰住這兒’之類的。</p>
<p>"Please, please," said Edmund suddenly, "pleasecouldn't I have just one piece of Turkish Delight to eat onthe way home?"</p>
<p>“求求你，”埃德蒙突然說道，“求求你，我能不能在回家的路上吃一塊土耳其軟糖？”</p>
<p>"No, no," said the Queen with a laugh, "you must waittill next time."  While she spoke, she signalled to the Dwarfto drive on, but as the sledge swept away out of sight, theQueen waved to Edmund calling out, "Next time!  Nexttime!  Don't forget.  Come soon."</p>
<p>“不行，不行，”王后笑著說，“你得等到下次。”說著，她示意矮人繼續趕雪橇，但當雪橇飛馳而去，消失在視線中時，王后向埃德蒙揮手，喊道：“下次！下次！別忘了。快點來。”</p>
<p>Edmund was still staring after the sledge when heheard someone calling his own name, and looking roundhe saw Lucy coming towards him from another part of thewood.</p>
<p>艾德蒙還在望著雪橇遠去的背影，這時他聽到有人在叫他的名字，回頭一看，只見露西正從樹林的另一邊朝他走來。</p>
<p>"Oh, Edmund!" she cried.  "So you've got in too!  Isn'tit wonderful, and now—"</p>
<p>“哦，埃德蒙！”她喊道，“你也進來了！真是太棒了，現在——”</p>
<p>"All right," said Edmund, "I see you were right and itis a magic wardrobe after all.  I'll say I'm sorry if youlike.  But where on earth have you been all this time?  I'vebeen looking for you everywhere."</p>
<p>“好吧，”埃德蒙說，“看來你是對的，這果然是個魔法衣櫥。如果你願意，我可以向你道歉。可是你這些日子都去哪兒了？我到處找你呢。”</p>
<p>"If I'd known you had got in I'd have waited for you,"said Lucy who was too happy and excited to notice howsnappishly Edmund spoke or how flushed and strange hisface was.  "I've been having lunch with dear Mr. Tumnus,the Faun, and he's very well and the White Witch has donenothing to him for letting me go, so he thinks she can'thave found out and perhaps everything is going to be allright after all."</p>
<p>「如果我知道你進去了，我一定會等你的。」露西興奮地說，她高興得根本沒注意到埃德蒙說話的語氣有多生硬，也沒注意到他漲得通紅，臉色怪異。 「我和親愛的圖姆努斯先生，那位半羊人，一起吃了午飯，他很好。白女巫也沒因為我放我走而責怪他，所以他覺得她不可能知道，也許一切都會好起來的。”</p>
<p>"The White Witch?" said Edmund, "who's she?"</p>
<p>“白女巫？”埃德蒙問，“她是誰？”</p>
<p>"She is a perfectly terrible person," said Lucy.  "Shecalls herself the Queen of Narnia though she has no rightto be queen at all, and all the Fauns and Dryads andNaiads and dwarfs and animals—at least all the goodones—simply hate her.  And she can turn people into stoneand do all kinds of horrible things.  And she has made amagic so that it is always winter in Narnia—always winter,but it never gets to Christmas.  And she drives about on asledge, drawn by a reindeer, with her wand in her handand a crown on her head."</p>
<p>「她是個十足的壞人。」露西說。 「她自稱是納尼亞女王，但她根本沒有資格當女王。所有的半人半羊的牧神、樹精、水仙女、矮人和動物——至少所有善良的——都恨她入骨。她能把人變成石頭，還能做各種可怕的事情。她施了魔法，讓納尼亞永遠都是王冠——永遠是冬天，冬天卻能做過各種可怕的事情。她施了魔法，讓納尼亞帶著雪橇處，永遠是冬天，冬天卻做不著聖誕節。</p>
<p>Edmund was already feeling uncomfortable from havingeaten too many sweets, and when he heard that theLady he had made friends with was a dangerous witch hefelt even more uncomfortable.  But he still wanted to tastethat Turkish Delight again more than he wanted anythingelse.</p>
<p>艾德蒙已經因為吃了太多甜食而感到不舒服，當他聽說自己認識的那位女士是個危險的女巫時，他更難受了。但他還是比什麼都更想再嚐嚐那塊土耳其軟糖。</p>
<p>"Who told you all that stuff about the White Witch?"he asked.</p>
<p>「誰跟你說的白女巫的事？」他問。</p>
<p>"Mr. Tumnus, the Faun," said Lucy.</p>
<p>「是牧神圖姆努斯先生，」露西說。</p>
<p>"You can't always believe what Fauns say," saidEdmund, trying to sound as if he knew far more about themthan Lucy.</p>
<p>「你不能總是相信半人半羊人說的話，」艾德蒙說道，努力讓自己聽起來比露西更了解他們。</p>
<p>"Who said so?" asked Lucy.</p>
<p>「誰說的？」露西問。</p>
<p>"Everyone knows it," said Edmund, "ask anybody youlike.  But it's pretty poor sport standing here in the snow.Let's go home."</p>
<p>“人人都知道，”埃德蒙說，“你想問誰就問誰。不過站在雪地裡實在太沒意思了。我們回家吧。”</p>
<p>"Yes, let's," said Lucy.  "Oh Edmund, I <i>am</i> glad you'vegot in too.  The others will have to believe in Narnia nowthat both of us have been there.  What fun it will be."</p>
<p>「好啊，我們回家吧，」露西說。 「哦，埃德蒙，我很高興你也來了。既然我們倆都去過納尼亞，其他人肯定也得相信那裡的存在了。那該多有趣啊！”</p>
<p>But Edmund secretly thought that it would not be asgood fun for him as for her.  He would have to admit thatLucy had been right, before all the others, and he felt surethe others would all be on the side of the Fauns and theanimals; but he was already more than half on the side ofthe Witch.  He did not know what he would say, or howhe would keep his secret once they were all talking aboutNarnia.</p>
<p>但埃德蒙心裡卻暗自覺得，對他來說，這樂趣恐怕不如對她那麼大。他不得不承認露西是對的，而且是在其他人之前就承認了。他確信其他人都會站在半人半羊人和動物們這邊；但他自己卻已經半信半疑地站在女巫那邊了。他不知道自己該怎麼說，也不知道一旦大家開始談論納尼亞，他該如何保守自己的秘密。</p>
<p>By this time they had walked a good way.  Then suddenlythey felt coats around them instead of branches and nextmoment they were both standing outside the wardrobe inthe empty room.</p>
<p>這時他們已經走了很遠的路。突然，他們感覺周圍不再是樹枝，而是外套，下一刻，他們就站在空蕩蕩的房間裡，衣櫃門外。</p>
<p>"I say," said Lucy, "you do look awful, Edmund.  Don'tyou feel well?"</p>
<p>“我說，”露西說，“埃德蒙，你看起來很糟糕。你不舒服嗎？”</p>
<p>"I'm all right," said Edmund, but this was not true.  Hewas feeling very sick.</p>
